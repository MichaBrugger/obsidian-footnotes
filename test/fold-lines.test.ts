// Jason's report (2026-09-11): a folded heading whose section the lint
// edits still unfolded. Probed live: Obsidian drops a heading fold on ANY
// edit inside it, even one character, so this is not about the shape of
// the edit. The plugin keeps the folds itself: it reads the view's fold
// list before the rewrite, maps each fold's line numbers through the
// edits, and puts the list back afterwards. mapFoldLines is the mapping.
