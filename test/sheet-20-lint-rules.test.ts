// Manual sheet 20, "the lint rules, alone and together", used to ask Jason
// to set seven settings combos by hand, run Lint footnotes, and eyeball the
// note against a fence of expected text. That is a pure text outcome, so it
// belongs here instead of in six hours of hand-testing.
//
// This file replaces these boxes of sheet 20:
//   A  the all-rules-on fence, the orphan alert naming "3" and "lost",
//      and the second lint changing nothing
//   B  the punctuation-only fence, and the closing-mark box under it
//   C  the move-to-bottom-only fence
//   D  the reindex-only fence
//   E  both E boxes: the all-on fence with orphaned definitions deleted,
//      and the same with reindex turned off
//   F  the all-on fence with named footnotes renumbered
//   G  the all-on fence with the "# Footnotes" section heading
//   H  the half of the box that says the note is untouched (the toast that
//      box also asks about is raised from main.ts and stays on sheet 22)
//   I  both boxes: the definition parked below an indented code chunk, and
//      the second lint changing nothing
//
// What stays on the sheet: the fold-and-caret box under A, which only the
// real editor can show.

// The sheet's one fixture, copied line for line. The fullwidth "。" and
// "？!" are there on purpose: they are the CJK punctuation the reference
// has to hop over.
