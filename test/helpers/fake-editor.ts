// The shared fake-editor family for unit tests. Every spec used to
// hand-roll its own `fakeEditor` (39 copies at the 2026-08-25 count),
// each with its own `as unknown as Editor` cast; this module owns that
// cast in ONE place and keeps the fakes honest by funneling every edit
// through `simulateChanges` — the exact CodeMirror change-application
// order the commands' born-dead simulation relies on.
//
// Capabilities are OPT-IN because a capability's absence is itself a
// contract: a fake built without `wholeDoc` proves the code under test
// reads individual lines and never the whole document (the
// footnote-prefix perf rule, 2026-08-11), one built without `edits`
// proves a navigation press never writes, one built without `words`
// proves the end-of-word adjustment stayed off. A disabled method
// THROWS naming its option instead of being undefined — the same test
// failure as the old missing-method TypeError, but the message says
// which contract fired.
//
// Purpose-built doubles stay local to their specs: the replaceMinimal
// fake in mutation-hardening-linter.test.ts applies edits by OFFSET
// SPLICING on a value string precisely so it cannot share
// simulateChanges' semantics with the code it checks.
