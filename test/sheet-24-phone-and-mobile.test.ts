// Manual sheet 24, "phone and mobile-emulation checks".
//
// Almost every check on that sheet needs the phone itself: how the dialog
// sits above the on-screen keyboard, what Obsidian's own long-press menu
// offers, how the popup's label reads on a theme, whether a toolbar tap
// launches a command. None of that is reachable from a unit test, so the
// sheet keeps those checks.
//
// One check is not about the phone at all. The sheet's refused-name box
// says to "type a name that is already taken (`menu` itself, or one that
// fails the rules)" and expect the dialog to show an error. The phone part
// of that box (the keyboard staying up, the field focused, its text
// selected) stays on the sheet. What the planner decides for each of those
// three names is text, and it is what this file pins, because the sheet's
// first suggestion does not do what the sheet says.
//
// Sheet item replaced: none outright. This file covers the naming half of
// the "Rename footnote from the toolbar with a refused name" box, so that
// the box on the sheet can name a value that really is refused.
//
// The sheet's own fixture note, as the sheet holds it.
