// Manual former sheet 21, "lint stability paranoia", has one fixture and two
// boxes, both of them pure text outcomes: what the lint does to a note
// whose very first line is a definition with a "---" right under it, and
// whether a second run churns. Both move here.
//
// This file replaces both boxes of former sheet 21. Nothing is left for the sheet,
// so former sheet 21 now says so in two lines.
//
// Heads up, and the reason one test below is marked `it.fails`: the sheet's
// first box was written on 2026-08-10, before the 2026-09-16 ruling about
// setext underlines. A "[^t1]: def" line with "---" directly under it is a
// HEADING to Obsidian, not a definition, so the lint deliberately leaves it
// where it is and the underlined-definition alert speaks instead. The sheet
// still describes the old behaviour, where the definition was moved down.

// The sheet's fixture is the top of the sheet note itself: the definition
// on line 0, a "---" right below it, and prose past the second "---" so a
// lint that minted frontmatter would visibly swallow something.
