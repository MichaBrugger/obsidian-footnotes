// Manual former sheet 23, "what the linter alerts about instead of fixing". Every
// box on it is an alert's text or a lint's text outcome, both of which a
// unit test can read, so the whole sheet moves here.
//
// This file replaces these boxes of former sheet 23:
//   the two orphan boxes and the empty-reference box
//   both "Delete orphaned references / definitions ON" boxes
//   both boxes under "A definition one blank line short"
//   both boxes under "Invalid names"
//   the nesting box
//   the code-inside-a-definition box
//   the "Merge OFF" duplicate box and the "lint again" idempotence box
//   the "every alert lists EVERY one" box
//   the first box under "Definitions inside a list item"
//
// Three of them are marked `it.fails`: the sheet and the code disagree, and
// each one says below what the code does instead. Nothing is left for a
// human to judge, so former sheet 23 now says so in two lines.
//
// The alerts always describe the text AFTER the lint has run, so every test
// here lints first and then asks the alerts about the result, exactly as
// the plugin does.
