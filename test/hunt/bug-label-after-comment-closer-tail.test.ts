// A multi-line comment that opened MID-LINE is inline HTML, so its closer
// line keeps whatever live text follows the "-->": "x <!-- a\n--> tail"
// is ONE paragraph, and the plugin itself agrees - bug-comment-boundary-lines
// pins that a reference in that tail is live ("a reference after an inline
// comment closer still counts").
//
// So a "[^1]:" label directly under such a closer line sits directly under
// a PROSE line, and manual sheet 25's rule (Obsidian's, matched by the
// plugin since 2026-09-09) says it is lazy paragraph text: "A label starts
// a definition only after a blank line, the note start, a heading, a
// closed fence, a callout's title line, or another definition." A prose
// line is none of those.
//
// The scanner's own math branch already encodes exactly this: for a "$$"
// closer line it asks whether live text follows the closer and reports a
// paragraph when it does ("verified in Reading view", markdown-scan.ts
// definitionStartLines). The comment branch has no such check: ANY closer
// line of an inline comment ends the block, so the label under "--> tail"
// is read as a real definition.
//
// What the user sees: their "[^1]: definition" line renders as plain
// paragraph text in Reading view, but the linter never says so - with the
// fix toggle ON no blank line is inserted (the label is "already a
// definition"), and with it OFF the lazy-definition alert never names it.
// The missing-definition alert stays silent too, because as far as the
// plugin is concerned the definition exists.
//
// Source of truth: manual sheet 25's stated rule (a label directly under a
// prose line is lazy) + the plugin's own math-branch precedent (verified
// in Reading view per the code comment).
//
// Settings involved: `Fix definitions hidden by a missing blank line` and
// its alert twin when the toggle is off.
