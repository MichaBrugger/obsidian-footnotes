// BUG: an orphaned definition whose cut leaves a "---" (or "===") rule line
// directly at the cut's edge is refused on the first lint for the wrong
// reason, and the second lint then performs the very same cut - lint twice
// is not lint once.
//
// The note "[^1]: body\n    cont\n---" holds an orphaned definition (nothing
// references [^1]; the "---" under its indented continuation is a thematic
// break, micromark: footnoteDefinition then thematicBreak). The cut of the
// definition's block leaves the rule at the very front of the note, and
// removeLineRanges' stranded-frontmatter guard fires: a bare "---" first is
// only provisionally a rule, so the guard prepends a blank line. The result
// ["", "---"] is exactly right - the rule reads the same either way - but
// linesReadDifferently then compares the kept lines against the result and
// sees out[0] = "" where the kept line was "---", a non-blank mismatch, and
// REFUSES the cut. The rule's own protective blank defeats its own
// kept-line comparison.
//
// So the first lint (with `Delete orphaned definitions` ON) leaves the
// orphan in place and instead gathers it below the rule (move-to-bottom,
// former sheet 21's layout), where the definition no longer touches the rule and
// the SAME cut is clean: the second lint deletes the orphan, the third says
// nothing. Manual former sheet 20 pins the contract this breaks: "run lint AGAIN
// (it must say 'No linting needed.')".
//
// What the user would see: with the delete toggle on, the first lint
// "Footnotes linted." moves the orphan under their horizontal rule, the
// second lint silently deletes it, and only a third lint goes quiet - two
// lints to settle a note.
//
// Source of truth: the rule's own refusal contract ("a deletion that changes
// how Obsidian reads a line it did not touch is refused" - the rule here
// changes NO line's reading, micromark: footnoteDefinition + thematicBreak
// before, "" + thematicBreak after) + manual former sheet 20's second-lint
// contract + the idempotence property the suite already pins.
//
// Settings involved: `Delete orphaned definitions` ON, `Move definitions to
// the bottom` ON (defaults).
