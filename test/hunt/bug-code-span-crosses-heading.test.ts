// A code span lives inside ONE paragraph: CommonMark lets it wrap across
// the lines of a paragraph, and the plugin matches (sheet 18's B30,
// 2026-09-16). A HEADING is not a paragraph - it is a leaf block whose
// inline content ends with the line. A backtick run opened in a heading
// has no later line to close on; it is a literal backtick.
//
// The scanner's cross-line span search (closesAhead in markdown-scan.ts)
// stops at every construct that ENDS a paragraph, but it never asks
// whether the OPENER's own line can carry a span across lines at all.
// From "# `code" it finds the closer on the next line and masks the
// heading's tail plus the next line's opener as one code span - so the
// [^1] inside the heading is dead text to the plugin.
//
// Verified against micromark: "# `code[^1]\nspan` tail\n\n[^1]: def"
// parses as heading(text "`code", footnoteReference#1) + paragraph +
// footnoteDefinition#1 - the reference in the heading is LIVE.
//
// What the user sees: their footnote reference renders fine in Reading
// view, but the plugin's half of the world disagrees - the definition is
// an orphan to the linter (alerted, or DELETED with `Delete orphaned
// definitions` ON), and with another numbered footnote in the note,
// reindex renames the definition while the heading's reference stays
// put, silently retargeting it.
//
// Source of truth: CommonMark's code-span rule (a span wraps only within
// one paragraph; a heading is a leaf block) via micromark as run for
// this hunt + sheet 18's B30 (the paragraph case the plugin matches).
//
// Settings involved: `Delete orphaned definitions` (the destructive
// half), the default reindex and alerts for the rest.
