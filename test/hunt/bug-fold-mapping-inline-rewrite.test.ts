// Scenario: a note with a folded heading or a folded list, linted with the
// default settings. The lint only rewrites characters inside lines, but
// because two lines next to each other both change, the write-back turns
// them into one edit spanning both, and the fold that ends (or begins) in
// that span comes back a line short or does not come back at all.
//
// What the user would see: exactly Jason's original complaint from former sheet 20
// line 27, back again in a narrower form. They fold a heading or a list,
// press Ctrl+S, and the lint runs. The heading is still folded but one line
// of what was hidden is now showing under it, or the fold is gone entirely
// and the whole section is open again. Nothing was deleted; every line is
// still there.
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13
// Lens: the minimal write-back and the fold restore (attack-surface row 4).
//
// Source of truth: manual sheet 12 line 19 ("Fold a heading and a bulleted
// list in this note (any of them, including one the lint will edit
// inside), put the caret on an unchanged line, and Ctrl+S: the note is
// linted, every fold is still folded, and the caret is still where it
// was"); manual former sheet 20 line 27, Jason's original fold complaint ("after
// the lint the section is still folded and the caret is still on that line
// at the same column"); and the module comment on mapFoldLines itself,
// which licenses exactly one kind of loss and no other: "A fold whose
// heading line the edits removed is dropped; a fold whose last line was
// removed ends on the line before the removal." Nothing here is removed.
//
// Two mechanisms, both in mapFoldLines:
//
// 1. Every fold line is mapped by the offset its line STARTS at, and
//    mapOffset collapses any offset that falls strictly inside an edit back
//    to where that edit begins. When the lint rewrites two lines that sit
//    next to each other, lineDiffChanges emits them as ONE replacement
//    covering both, for example {from:19, to:30, text:"1]: two\n[^2"} for a
//    reindex that swaps the names on two adjacent definition lines. The
//    second line's start is inside that edit, so it collapses onto the
//    first line and the fold loses a line. If the edit covers the fold's
//    whole range, the fold ends where it starts and is thrown away.
//
// 2. The removed(line) predicate asks whether any edit covers a line's
//    whole span. A multi-line replacement covers the whole span of every
//    line in its middle, so a surviving line inside one is treated as
//    deleted. A fold whose last line is such a line is pulled back a line
//    and can collapse to nothing.
//
// The folded-list case below fails for a further reason on top of these:
// the line comparison pairs up repeated lines by position, so a renumbered
// child in a list of identical-looking children reads as one line deleted
// and another inserted, which shortens the fold.
//
// Header note: whether Obsidian's applyFoldInfo honours the "to" we hand it
// or re-derives a heading fold's range from the heading itself is a
// question only a live editor can answer, so the one-line shrink may or may
// not be visible for a HEADING fold. The outright drops reproduce the
// complaint either way, and a list fold has no heading to re-derive from.
//
// Settings: the defaults, and any lint trigger (the command, on save, or on
// footnote creation). The fixtures below are real lintFootnotes output.
