// The scanner's paragraphGoesOn ends a paragraph's line-run at any line
// matching /^ {0,3}%%/ - meant for a "%%" BLOCK opener (a lone "%%"). But
// the same regex matches an INLINE comment pair line ("%% c %%"), which
// sheet 18 (2026-09-09) rules is an ordinary paragraph line: "a
// comment-only line is still a paragraph line". So every cross-line
// lookahead that goes through paragraphGoesOn stops one line early:
//
// 1. A code span opened on one line and closing on a later line of the
//    same paragraph (Reading view renders it as ONE span, sheet 18 B30,
//    2026-09-16) stops at the inline-comment line. The reference the span
//    covers stays LIVE to the plugin where Reading view shows it as dead
//    code text.
// 2. An unclosed "<!--" opened mid-line is literal only when no later
//    line of the SAME paragraph closes it (the cycle-3 literalOpeners
//    ruling). The search stops at the inline-comment line, so a closer
//    right after it pairs with nothing: the reference after the opener
//    stays live where Reading view hides it in the comment.
// 3. The same for an unclosed "$$" opened mid-line: the closer line then
//    opens a phantom math BLOCK at its own content start, dead to the end
//    of the note, swallowing everything below.
//
// What the user sees: references inside real code spans and comments get
// counted, renumbered, and alerted on as if they were live, and in the
// math case the note's whole tail goes dead to the linter - move-to-
// bottom refuses to run at all (endsProtected), so their definitions are
// never gathered.
//
// Source of truth: manual sheet 18 ("a comment-only line is still a
// paragraph line", and B30: a wrapped code span is one span to Reading
// view) + the literalOpeners ruling's own condition (the search runs
// through "a later line of the SAME paragraph" - and an inline-comment
// line is one).
//
// Settings involved: none (scanner-level); the lint symptoms ride the
// defaults.
