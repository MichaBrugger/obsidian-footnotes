// The visible tail after an Obsidian "%%" BLOCK comment's closer is live
// paragraph text (sheet 11: "%% [^3]: def" renders as a definition, and
// the scan's own definitionStartLines reads a closer line with a tail as
// `open = "paragraph"`). A GFM table cannot start directly under a line
// of paragraph text (pinned in Reading view, cycle 3: "a table header
// directly under plain paragraph text ... is no table at all"), so the
// header row under "%% tail" is ordinary paragraph text too.
//
// tableRowLinesOf's paragraphTextAbove guard disagrees with all of that:
// its plainText test treats any line whose only "%%" is at the content
// start as "not paragraph text" (the branch exists for the block OPENER
// and for the bare closer, which both stand at a block boundary). On the
// closer-with-tail line it fires wrongly, so the run under the tail is
// detected as a TABLE.
//
// Downstream, definitionStartLines believes a label under that run ends a
// table and therefore starts a definition, and lazyDefinitionLabelNames
// then exempts it from the lazy-definition alert. Reading view renders
// the whole run - pipes and label alike - as one paragraph, so with the
// gather rule off the user's "[^1]: def" sits there as plain text and no
// alert ever names it: a silent miss of exactly the shape the
// lazy-definition alert exists for (former sheet 23), against the never-silent
// policy (ADR 0002).
//
// What the user sees: they typed a definition one blank line short below
// a comment block's "%% tail" line; the lint neither fixes nor reports
// it, and reindex numbers a "definition" Obsidian shows as prose.
//
// Source of truth: sheet 11 (the tail after a closer is live) + the
// cycle-3 Reading-view probe (no table under a paragraph line) + the
// scan's own paragraph reading of the tail line.
//
// Settings involved: `Move definitions to the bottom` off (with it on,
// the gather accidentally heals the label); `Fix definitions hidden by a
// missing blank line` on or off - both the fix and the alert miss.
