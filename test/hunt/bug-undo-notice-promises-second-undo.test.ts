// Jason's manual pass (2026-09-11): the partial-undo notice said "Undo
// again to remove the reference too" after EVERY undo that removed a
// definition while its reference stayed, whether or not a second undo
// would remove that reference. The promise is only true when the plugin
// itself split the creation into two history steps (a table-cell creation:
// reference through the cell's editor, definition through the main
// editor). Everywhere else the notice states the fact and stops.
