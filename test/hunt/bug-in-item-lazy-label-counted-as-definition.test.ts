// Imported from the opus-cycle-1 hunt of 2026-09-21 (OpenCode worktree); all pins flipped green 2026-09-21 after the fix.
// RESOLVED 2026-09-21 (probed in Reading view: a label directly under an item's prose renders as plain text, one after a blank line or an empty item as a definition). The in-item reader now needs a boundary above the label.
// Opus hunt cycle 1 of 2026-09-20 (worktree opus-cycle-1). 4 of 6 tests
// carry it.fails; the two controls do not.

// A label written inside a list item DIRECTLY UNDER a line of prose:
//
//     - item text
//         [^lc]: straight under the marker line
//
//     use[^lc] here
//
// The plugin's recorded prose-label rule (former sheet 14, and the shared
// generator's own "- item[^91]" / "  [^91]: lazy under a list item" case)
// says a label directly under a line of prose - paragraph text, a list
// item, a quote line - is LAZY: Obsidian folds it into the paragraph above
// and renders the characters "[^lc]: ..." as plain text. Every margin
// reader implements that, which is why the column-0 twin ("para" then
// "[^ld]: lazy") is named by the lazy-definition alert.
//
// inItemDefinitionLabels has no laziness rule at all. Its second branch
// asks only three things of a line: an item is open, the margin readers did
// not already claim it (`starts[i]`), and it is indented four columns or
// more. A label under the item's own prose passes all three, so the reader
// reports it as a real in-item definition - and so does a label under a
// QUOTED prose line inside the item, which the recorded rule (cycle 8, "a
// quoted label directly under a quoted paragraph line is lazy prose") also
// calls lazy.
//
// What the user sees: NOTHING, which is the problem. Ruling 1 of
// 2026-09-20 wired the in-item reader into the orphan-reference alert, so
// "[^lc]" in the body now counts as defined and the orphan alert stays
// quiet; the lazy-definition alert is a margin reader and never looked
// inside the item, so it stays quiet too. The note renders with a footnote
// reference pointing at nothing and a line of literal "[^lc]: ..." text in
// the list, and the lint tells the user neither - exactly the silent miss
// the never-silent policy forbids (ADR 0002). The hotkey inherits it:
// pressed on "[^lc]", it navigates to the fake definition (or opens the
// popup on it) instead of writing a real one.
//
// Source of truth: the prose-label rule as former sheet 14 records it and as the
// column-0 control below shows it working, the cycle-8 ruling for the
// quoted spelling, and ADR 0002 (never silent).
//
// Settings involved: none for the reader; `Delete orphaned references` and
// the lint alerts inherit the answer, and `Fix definitions hidden by a
// missing blank line` cannot reach the label either.
