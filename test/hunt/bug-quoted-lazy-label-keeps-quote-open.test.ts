// Imported from the GLM 5.3 Flash cycle 4 hunt of 2026-09-16 (OpenCode worktree); 2 of 6 tests carry it.fails: 0 were red there and marked on import, the rest the hunter marked itself.
// Hunt cycle 8 (GLM 5.3 Flash, 2026-09-16): a quoted LAZY label keeps the
// scanner's quote state "in a definition", so an indented quoted chunk
// after the blank quote line is read as live footnote text instead of
// quoted code.
//
// Scenario (a quote holding prose, a lazy label, a blank quote line, and an
// indented chunk citing a footnote):
//
//   > para
//   > [^1]: lazy
//   >
//   >     chunk[^73]
//
// What the user would see in Reading view: the label line is paragraph
// text (manual sheet 25's callout fixture proves a quoted label under a
// quoted body line renders as plain "[^1]: ..." prose, not a definition),
// so this is "after a plain quoted paragraph" - the chunk renders as
// quoted CODE with the literal string "chunk[^73]". The plugin's own
// pinned control says exactly that: "after a plain quoted paragraph it is
// quoted code" (test/hunt/bug-quoted-definition-chunk-after-gap.test.ts).
//
// What goes wrong: scanDocument sets quote.inDefinition from
// definitionLabelIn on the RAW line (markdown-scan.ts, the quoted-line
// branch: "quote.inDefinition = definitionLabelIn(src[i]) !== null ||
// ..."). The raw label is there, so the quote is treated as inside a
// definition even though definitionStartLines - which judges the MASKED
// twin, like every other label reader - says the label is lazy and starts
// nothing. The chunk then fails the "quoted code" test
// (quote.boundary && !quote.inDefinition) and stays live. The scanner's
// two readers disagree about the same lines, the exact shape the cycle-5
// pin fixed in the other direction.
//
// What the user would see from the plugin: the [^73] in the code chunk is
// counted as a live reference - reindex numbers it, the missing-definition
// alert names it, and with "Delete orphaned references" on, the lint cuts
// it out of the code text (ADR-0002: lint never touches code).
//
// Source of truth: manual sheet 25 (a quoted label directly under a quote
// or callout body line is lazy prose) + the pinned quoted-paragraph
// control in bug-quoted-definition-chunk-after-gap.test.ts.
//
// Settings involved: none (the scan itself); every rule inherits the
// misread.
