// GLM 5.3 Flash cycle 11 hunt of 2026-09-16 (OpenCode worktree glm-cycle-7). 2 of 3 tests carry it.fails; the control does not.
// BUG: when one of two definitions of a name is a GFM table riding its
// label line ("[^1]: | a | b |" plus its delimiter row), the merge folds
// the table into the FIRST definition as body text. The rule's contract
// is "The merged bodies arrive as INDENTED continuation lines ... The
// indented form looks identical when rendered and stays one block" - true
// for prose bodies, false for a table: the pinned rendering (GLM hunt
// cycle 3, probed in Reading view) is that a table starting on a label
// line belongs to the footnote and RENDERS AS A TABLE. After the merge,
// the header row is an indented continuation line of the survivor (part
// of the footnote's text), and the delimiter row and rows are column-0
// lines under the definition, which no longer have a header - Reading
// view shows them as a paragraph of literal pipes. The table's structure
// is destroyed without the destructive-change notice any other reshape
// gets; the duplicate merge is the one lint rule allowed to reshape
// structure, and this shape is outside what its indented-continuation
// form can carry.
//
// What the user sees: a footnote defined twice, one copy holding a
// table, merges into a footnote whose table is gone - body text reads
// "first | a | b |" and the remaining rows render as pipe text with no
// table.
//
// Source of truth: the merge rule's own rendering contract (the file
// header: "The indented form looks identical when rendered") + the
// pinned Reading-view probe that a table starting on a label line
// renders inside the footnote (GLM hunt cycle 3, and the column-0 rows
// belong to the block - findDefinitionBlocks' table-on-label walk, which
// this pin shows already spans the rows).
//
// Settings involved: `Merge duplicate definitions` (the rule itself; the
// lint runs it when the toggle is on).
