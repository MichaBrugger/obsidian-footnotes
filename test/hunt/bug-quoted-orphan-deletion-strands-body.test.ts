// Scenario: an orphaned definition inside a blockquote, with an indented
// body line under its label, and that body line cites another footnote.
// The orphaned-definition rule used to cut the label line only, and the
// body line left behind changed meaning: it stopped being part of a
// definition and became quoted indented code. Its reference died with it,
// so the footnote it was keeping alive was an orphan on the next pass and
// was deleted too, one lint later, with nothing to connect the two.
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13
// Lens: the two orphan rules (attack-surface row 10).
//
// Source of truth: the GFM reference parser vendored in this repo
// (mdast-util-gfm-footnote). Before the cut, the indented quote line parses
// as a paragraph inside footnoteDefinition "9", holding a live
// footnoteReference "b". So the body is the definition's, and Obsidian's
// Reading view agrees: a quoted definition owns its continuation lines
// (verified 2026-09-16).
//
// The fix (2026-09-16): the rule gives a quoted definition the same block
// a column-0 definition gets, label and continuation together
// (quotedDefinitionEnd). The consequence follows the rule's own contract,
// "a definition only an orphan's body references dies with it": the
// quoted orphan and "[^b]" go in ONE call, exactly as the column-0 twin of
// the same note does, and a second run has nothing left to do. Nothing is
// stranded and nothing dies a lint later.
//
// Settings: "Delete orphaned definitions" on.
