// A name with a backtick in it ("[^tick`a]") is not a footnote to Obsidian
// at all - it cannot render (manual sheet 17). The lint's own policy for
// such names, in lint-alerts.ts, is: "a name the user typed by hand ...
// cannot be fixed automatically: there is no telling which name they
// meant. So the lint reports it instead" (the invalid-name alert). The
// orphaned-REFERENCE rule honors that: isOrphan refuses to delete a name
// isValidFootnoteName rejects, because "deleting it would destroy ordinary
// prose". Reindex already honors it for WHITESPACE names too: they take
// no slot in the renumbering order and are never rewritten
// (bug-reindex-whitespace-name-slot).
//
// But with `Renumber named footnotes` ON, reindex renames a backticked
// name like any other: "[^tick`a]" becomes "[^1]". Two things go wrong.
//
// One: the rename is exactly the automatic "fix" the alert policy says the
// lint must not do, and it happens SILENTLY - the invalid-name alert runs
// on the post-lint text, where the backticked name no longer exists, so it
// never fires (ADR-0002, never-silent).
//
// Two: the renamed reference is now a perfectly ordinary orphan, so a
// pipeline that also has `Delete orphaned references` ON eats it on the
// NEXT lint. "Lint twice equals lint once" breaks: pass 1 renames, pass 2
// deletes. With lint-on-save the user's sentence loses its footnote text
// on their second save, with no alert ever naming it.
//
// What the user sees: "[^tick`a] backtick" becomes "[^1] backtick" on the
// first lint (no warning), then "backtick" on the second (no warning).
//
// Source of truth: lint-alerts.ts's own stated policy (invalid names are
// reported, never auto-fixed) + the idempotence invariant pinned in
// test/properties.test.ts ("lint is idempotent for every document and
// option combo") + sheet 17's ground truth that a backticked name cannot
// render.
//
// Settings involved: `Renumber named footnotes` ON (non-default) for the
// rename; `Delete orphaned references` ON (non-default) for the deletion.
