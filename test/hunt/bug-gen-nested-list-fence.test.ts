// What a user sees: a fenced code block inside a NESTED list item
// ("- - ```" or "1. 1. ```") is not detected. The code inside counts as
// live prose (autonumbering skips numbers the code only happens to
// contain), and the intended closer line OPENS a phantom fence that
// swallows the rest of the note - protection exactly inverted, the
// bug-list-item-fence pattern one container level deeper.
//
// Root cause: scanDocument's fence-opener check strips ONE list marker
// from the line, then tries the fence pattern on what is left; for a
// nested item what is left carries a SECOND marker. Same composition
// failure as the pinned bug-gen-fence-in-quote-in-list ("- > ```"), with
// a list in place of the quote: that pin covers the container pair it
// names, this is the neighboring pair a fix must also compose.
//
// Ground truth: micromark parses "fake[^99]" as code inside the nested
// item's fence (the indented variant, where the content reaches the inner
// item's margin).
