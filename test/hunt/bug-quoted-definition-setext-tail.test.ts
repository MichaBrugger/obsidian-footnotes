// A setext underline directly under a definition's LAZY CONTINUATION line
// pulls that line out of the footnote and makes it a heading: "[^1]: body",
// "cont", "===" renders as a footnote reading "body" plus a heading
// reading "cont" (Kimi hunt cycle 3, probed in Reading view 2026-09-16).
// The column-0 block walker knows: findDefinitionBlocks stops before a
// plain line that a setext underline follows.
//
// The QUOTED walker never got the same check. quotedDefinitionEnd happily
// absorbs "> cont" and the "> ===" under it into the quoted definition's
// extent, so every consumer of that extent disagrees with the column-0
// reading of the identical unquoted text:
//
// - Orphaned-definition deletion cuts the heading "cont" and the "==="
//   away with the label, eating text Reading view shows as a heading, not
//   as the footnote's body (the never-eat-user-text promise, ADR-0002).
// - The nesting guards (quotedDefinitionLabelAbove) refuse a footnote
//   press on the heading line, calling it "inside a definition".
// - The jump from the reference lands past the heading line.
//
// What the user sees: with `Delete orphaned definitions` ON, a quoted
// footnote nothing references is removed - and the heading below it,
// which was never part of the footnote, vanishes with it.
//
// Source of truth: the cycle-3 Reading view probe (a setext underline
// under a lazy continuation pulls that line out as a heading) + the
// plugin's own column-0 walker, which stops before such a line; the
// quoted walker is the same question and must give the same answer.
//
// Settings involved: `Delete orphaned definitions` ON for the cut; the
// walker disagreement itself needs no setting.
