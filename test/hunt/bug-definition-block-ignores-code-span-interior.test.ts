// A code span that opens on a definition's label line and closes several
// lines later keeps every line in between dead (Reading view renders the
// whole stretch as one span, manual sheet 18 B30 2026-09-16; the scanner
// protects the no-backtick lines in full through startsInCode). The
// definition block owns all of it, the way it owns a comment, math, or
// fence region one of its lines opens: the footnote's body reads "a `code
// more [^2] fake span`" with the [^2] dead inside the code.
//
// findDefinitionBlocks absorbs startsInComment, startsInMath, and
// startsInFence lines, but NOT startsInCode lines: a protected line that
// carries no backtick ends the block at the label. So move-to-bottom packs
// the label line alone, leaving the span's body lines behind, and reindex
// swaps the label alone between definition slots. Either way the label
// leaves its body behind; with the "`code" opener gone from its old spot,
// the stranded lines re-read as live text and the fake [^2] wakes up.
//
// What the user sees: after a lint, their footnote's body is split - the
// definition at the bottom ends mid-sentence with a literal backtick, and
// the paragraph where the definition used to be now shows a superscript
// [^2] that was code before. The next lint's orphan alert names [^2], and
// with `Delete orphaned references` ON a later lint deletes it - user text
// destroyed across two lints. Conservation (no live text lost) is broken.
//
// Source of truth: manual sheet 18's B30 ruling (a wrapped code span is
// ONE span to Reading view; the reference inside it is dead) + the block
// walker's own absorb rule for regions a definition's lines open (Sol bug
// #3, hunt 2026-08-25), which startsInCode lines belong to.
//
// Settings involved: `Move definitions to the bottom` ON (the default);
// the full lint shows the same split.
