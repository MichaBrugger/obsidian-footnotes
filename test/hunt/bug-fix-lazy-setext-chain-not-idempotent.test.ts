// Scenario: a note holding "para" / "[^1]: a" / "===" / "[^2]: b", where the
// "===" line sits between two labels. Fixing the first lazy label changes
// what the "===" line means, which turns the second label lazy, and the
// rule stops before fixing that one.
//
// What the user would see: they run the lint, it reports that it linted,
// and the note still has a "[^2]: b" line showing as plain text instead of
// a footnote. They run it again and the note changes again, and the
// footnote numbers swap around on the way: the first run leaves
// "x[^2] y[^1]" and the second turns it into "x[^1] y[^2]". Only the third
// run says "No linting needed." If they have lint on save turned on, two
// saves in a row rewrite the note twice, which also means two separate
// steps to undo.
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13
// Lens: the fix-lazy-definitions rule (idempotence and the rules it feeds).
//
// Source of truth: the rule's own invariant, asserted in
// test/fix-lazy-definitions.test.ts ("never leaves a lazy label behind" -
// its generator emits no "===" line, which is why the property never
// reached this shape); the loop comment in
// src/linting/rules/fix-lazy-definitions.ts ("Each time round, at least the
// label being aimed at becomes a definition, so this always finishes. The
// loop count is only a safety net, not what actually stops it.");
// src/linting/linter.ts's statement that the rule order is chosen so "one
// lint settles the note; the other order would need a second pass"; manual
// sheet 25 line 74 ("Lint again without undoing: 'No linting needed.'");
// the attack-surface reference's fix-lazy row, which names this exact
// attack ("a lazy label whose 'fix' changes what the line above means
// (setext heading, table, list)").
//
// Why it happens: before the fix, the "===" line closes the paragraph above
// it, so the label under the "===" starts a definition and only the first
// label is lazy. The rule counts the lazy labels once, at the start, and
// uses that count as its loop limit. After it gives the first label its
// blank line, the "===" has no paragraph left to close, so it becomes an
// ordinary line of text, and the label under it turns lazy. The loop limit
// was one, so the rule hands the note back with a lazy label still in it.
//
// How the shape gets into a note: hand-typed only. No plugin command
// produces a label directly above a "===" line.
