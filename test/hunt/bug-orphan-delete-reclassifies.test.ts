// Found by the fast-check idempotence property (2026-08-10), ground truth
// verified against Obsidian's metadataCache: deleting the orphaned "[^42]"
// blanks the only paragraph between a definition and an indented chunk -
// and Obsidian continues a footnote definition across ANY run of blank
// lines, so the chunk flips from indented CODE to definition CONTINUATION.
// The next lint pass then saw "[^73]" as a live (orphaned) reference and
// deleted text the first pass had promised to protect. The rule now
// refuses any deletion that changes another line's protection
// classification; such orphans stay for the user to resolve.
