// The punctuation rule moves every reference that sits BEFORE punctuation
// to sit after it ("word[^1]." becomes "word.[^1]", and a run of adjacent
// references crosses a run of punctuation as one unit). Its one exception
// is a definition's own label: a reference run directly in front of a ":"
// with nothing but quote markers, "%", NULs, or whitespace in front of it
// is left alone, so "%% [^3]: def" and "> %% [^4]: def" are not mangled
// into ":[^3]" (the Claude-sweep guard).
//
// The guard's premise is "a run at the line's start before a colon is a
// label". But a definition label is ONE "[^name]" pair followed directly
// by ":" - a RUN of two or more pairs is never one (DefinitionStart
// requires the colon right after the name, and Obsidian agrees: "[^1][^2]:
// x" is two live references and a literal colon, never a definition).
// The rule's own single-reference behavior shows it: "see [^1]: x" becomes
// "see :[^1] x". The two-reference run at column 0 (or behind a quote
// marker) is the same shape, and the guard lets it keep the colon in
// front.
//
// What the user sees: "[^1][^2]: x" never gets its references placed after
// the colon, however many times the lint runs - the one placement the
// rule exists to make, skipped by a heuristic that mistook a reference
// run for a label.
//
// Source of truth: the rule's own convention (its catalogue examples and
// the colon behavior it applies to the single-reference shape) + the
// label grammar (DefinitionStart, one name then colon).
//
// Settings involved: `Move footnote references after punctuation` ON (the
// default).
