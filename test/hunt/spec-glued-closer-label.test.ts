// SPEC QUESTION: is a definition label GLUED to a %% block comment's
// closer ("%%[^1]: def", no space) a definition in Reading view, or is it
// still inside the comment?
//
// The probed ground truth (Jason's verification 2026-09-15, sheet 18 and
// the afterCloser comments) covers the SPACED form: "%% [^3]: def" renders
// as a definition. For the glued form nothing is recorded.
//
// The plugin cannot make up its mind, and the two answers are visible to
// the user at once:
//
// - definitionStartLines accepts it as a REAL definition start (the gap
//   check line.slice(close, label.nameStart - 2).trim() === "" is true for
//   an empty slice), so it gets gathered, renumbered, and its reference
//   binds;
// - commentedDefinitionNames ALSO names it in the "definition inside a %%
//   comment" alert (its guard is nameStart - 2 > close, false for a glued
//   label), telling the user Obsidian never shows it and to move it out.
//
// Both cannot be true: either the label renders (and the alert is noise
// on every lint), or it is dead (and the lint moves/renumbers a footnote
// Obsidian does not render, and may then delete its reference as an
// orphan once the user trusts the alert). Whichever way Reading view
// reads it, one of the two paths must change; until then the alert
// contradicts the rules that act on the same line.
//
// NEEDS A LIVE CHECK: does "%%[^1]: def" (no space after the closer)
// render a footnote entry in Reading view?
//
// Source of truth: the two code paths' own recorded contracts (the
// afterCloser ruling 2026-09-15 vs ADR 2's alert naming); Obsidian
// unprobed for the glued form.
// Settings involved: none (the alert is untied to any toggle).
