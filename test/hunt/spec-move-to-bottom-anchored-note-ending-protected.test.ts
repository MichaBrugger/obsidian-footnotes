// spec question: when a note has the section heading in the MIDDLE of it
// and the note ENDS inside an unclosed protected region (an unclosed code
// fence, or an unclosed "%%" comment), should move-to-bottom still gather
// the definitions under that heading, or stay off?
//
// Reading one, gather. The heading is the anchor and the definitions land
// under it, nowhere near the unclosed region at the end. The creation path
// (buildDefinitionAppend) already puts a brand new definition under the
// heading in exactly this note, and the move rule's own contract says the
// layout it produces "deliberately matches the one buildDefinitionAppend
// produces". On this reading the two paths currently disagree.
//
// Reading two, stay off. This is what the code does today: the
// endsProtected guard refuses the whole rule before it ever looks for the
// heading. The guard is older than the anchored path (8bab1b9, 2026-07-17,
// against 831bfc9, 2026-08-05) and was never revisited afterwards, so its
// blanket refusal may simply predate the case rather than cover it. When
// the rule only ever appended at the very bottom of the note, an unclosed
// region at the end really was in the way.
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13. Lens: interactions.
//
// How urgent it is not: the layout the creation path produces is already a
// fixed point of the move rule, so nothing churns back and forth and no
// note is damaged either way. The durable trigger is a note that ends in an
// unclosed "%%" by accident, usually a comment the writer never closed. In
// such a note the rule is silently off for as long as the "%%" stays open,
// and no alert says so.
