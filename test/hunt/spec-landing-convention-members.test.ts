// spec question: which characters belong to the landing convention, and
// does the walk need to know about wikilink aliases?
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13. Lens: the landing convention.
//
// TWO SEPARATE QUESTIONS, both for Jason.
//
// 1. The one-character ellipsis "\u2026".
//    The three-dot "..." is hopped (pinned in end-of-word-offset.test.ts);
//    the single character Obsidian's smart typography and most pasted
//    prose produce is not in TrailingPunctuationChars.
//    Reading A: the class should grow the member, because a reader cannot
//    tell the two spellings apart and the plugin should not either. That
//    is exactly how the CJK marks were settled on 2026-08-10.
//    Reading B: the class is a closed, deliberately small enumeration and
//    stays as it is, so nobody has to keep a growing Unicode list in step
//    across the three paths that share it.
//    Either way the two paths AGREE with each other today (the insert and
//    the lint rule both leave the single character alone), so this is a
//    question about the class, not an inconsistency bug.
//
// 2. An aliased wikilink, "[[some bravo|alias]]".
//    The walk has no model of wikilinks at all. The plain "[[some bravo]]"
//    case in former sheet 01 passes only by luck: "]" happens to be a closing
//    mark. With an alias the walk stops dead at the "|", so a press on the
//    target word writes the reference INSIDE the link target and the link
//    stops resolving.
//    Reading A: this is the link rule missing a case, and the walk should
//    step over a whole "[[...]]" the way it steps over "[text](url)".
//    Reading B: a press inside a wikilink's target is a user error, and
//    the press should refuse rather than guess where the reference goes.
//    Under reading A the assertions below are the wanted values; under
//    reading B they become a refusal test instead. Either way today's
//    silent link-breaking is not the answer.
//
// Source of truth for the shapes themselves: manual former sheet 01 (the closing
// marks list and the "[[some bravo]]" line), TrailingPunctuationChars and
// ClosingMarkChars in markdown-scan.ts, and the 2026-08-10 CJK ruling as
// the precedent for how the class grows.
//
// Noted, not asserted: a third wording question is open on the same
// convention, whether a reference already after a full stop but INSIDE a
// closing quote ('"quoted.[^q]" rest') should be moved outside the quote.
// That one was ruled on in 5ec4b66 and is pinned in
// test/footnote-after-punctuation.test.ts, so nothing here asserts against
// it.
