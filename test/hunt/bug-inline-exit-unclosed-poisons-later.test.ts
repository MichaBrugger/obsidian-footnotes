// BUG: an earlier UNCLOSED inline footnote poisons a later well-formed one.
// The bracket-depth scan counts every unescaped "[" as nesting, so the "[" that
// opens the second, closed "^[closed]" is swallowed as fake nesting for the
// first, unclosed "^[open...". The inner scan finds no matching close and the
// code does an unconditional `if (close === -1) return null;` instead of
// backtracking to the next candidate. Result: the cursor sitting inside a
// perfectly valid closed footnote gets no exit position, and insertInlineFootnote
// then splices a fresh literal "^[]" at the caret, corrupting the good footnote.
// Hunt: 2026-07-17. Lens: offsets. Severity: wrong-output.
