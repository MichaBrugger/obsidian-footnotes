// BUG (GLM hunt cycle 13, 2026-09-16): the orphaned-definitions rule
// follows deletion chains through definitions that are NEVER CUT. A label
// right after a "%%" block comment's closer ("%% [^a]: sees [^b]") is a
// real definition whose line holds the closer, so it is reported but never
// removed (holdsCloser, pinned: such orphans are never cut). The chain
// walk does not know that: when nothing references "a", it marks "a" dead
// and decrements the reference its body makes to "b", so "[^b]: b body" -
// whose only reference sits in the surviving closer line - is deleted.
//
// What the user sees: in Reading view, footnote "b" is still rendered (its
// reference lives in the text after the closer, which Obsidian shows),
// yet its definition is gone: a live reference the lint itself orphaned.
// The linter's own promise says this cannot happen: "Deleting an orphaned
// definition can never orphan a live reference, because a reference
// pointing at a definition is exactly what keeps that definition alive"
// (src/linting/linter.ts). And the duplicate-safe shape of the same
// ruling - "neither is ever cut or merged" for closer-line copies - is
// honored by the merge rule but not by the chain walk here.
//
// The orphaned-definition alert happens to name only "a" (its contract
// does not follow chains), so the deletion of "b" is silent: the user
// opted into "delete definitions nothing references" and lost one that
// something in the note does reference. ADR-0002: lint never eats text
// the user did not opt into losing.
//
// Source of truth: linter.ts's conservation promise + ADR-0002 +
// the recorded Reading-view ground truth that a label after a "%%" closer
// is a live definition whose body text is live (Jason's verification
// 2026-09-15, sheet 18).
//
// Settings involved: `Delete orphaned definitions` ON; the same shared
// walk also runs under Reindex with `Keep orphaned definitions` off.
