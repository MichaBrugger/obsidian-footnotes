// Scenario: a footnote definition whose LABEL line the block scanner does
// not recognise as opening a definition - a label directly under a LINK
// REFERENCE DEFINITION ("[foo]: /url"), under a GFM TABLE ROW, or after a
// "%%" block comment's closer - followed by a blank line and an INDENTED
// chunk that carries a reference-shaped string ("    code [^2]").
//
// What Obsidian does (both halves are recorded Reading-view ground truth):
// the label renders as a definition (spec-label-after-link-reference-
// definition, RESOLVED: "Reading view agrees with micromark"; Jason's A2
// ruling for the table row), and an indented line after a definition's
// blank line CONTINUES that definition, where a reference-shaped string
// "woke up as a live reference" (manual sheet 20, section I, Jason's
// ruling 2026-09-16 - the same swallowing move-to-bottom must avoid). So
// the chunk's "[^2]" is a live nested reference to footnote 2, and any
// renumbering of footnote 2 must rename it too.
//
// What the plugin does: definitionStartLines DOES know both label shapes
// and starts a block there, and findDefinitionBlocks even absorbs the
// indented chunk into that block (it is protected and starts with four
// spaces, so it is "absorbable"). But scanDocument's own indented-code
// decision never saw the definition open: its inDefinition state is set
// only when the label line passes the plain DefinitionStart check at a
// block boundary, and neither an LRD line nor a table row is a block
// ender. So the chunk is marked isProtected, its masked twin is all NULs,
// and the "[^2]" inside it is dead to every rename rule. reindex renames
// the definition to "[^2]" and reorders the blocks around it while the
// chunk keeps "[^2]" - in Reading view the nested citation now points at
// the wrong footnote (below, the chunk cited footnote "two" before the
// lint and cites the "body cites" definition after it; in the %% variant
// the citation ends up pointing at the definition that holds it).
//
// What the user sees: they run lint (reindex is on by default), nothing
// looks deleted, and a citation inside a footnote's continuation text
// silently changes which footnote it points to.
//
// Source of truth: manual sheet 20 §I ("the code stopped being code and a
// reference-shaped string inside it woke up as a live reference", Jason's
// ruling 2026-09-16) + the RESOLVED Reading-view probe recorded in
// spec-label-after-link-reference-definition.test.ts + the A2 ruling
// recorded in the definitionsInsideTable alert. Settings involved:
// `Reindex` (on by default); the same masked scan feeds every rename rule
// (apply-prefix, rename), so they all miss the chunk.
