// BUG (review A1, Jason confirmed live 2026-09-08): a definition-shaped
// line that CLOSES an HTML comment ("[^2]: two -->") is not protected as
// a whole - its live suffix after "-->" stays scannable - and
// findDefinitionBlocks matched DefinitionStart against the RAW line, so
// the label inside the comment read as a live definition block.
// Move-to-bottom then dragged the closer line (and the "-->" with it) to
// the bottom of the note, leaving the comment unclosed: everything after
// "<!--" vanished from the rendered note. Micromark parses the fixture as
// paragraph / html / paragraph with no footnoteDefinition at all. Every
// other definition reader already goes through the masked twin
// (definitionLabelWithName); the block walker now does too.
