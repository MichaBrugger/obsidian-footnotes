// A label after a %% block comment's closer on its line is a real
// definition that can never be CUT or MERGED (its line holds the comment's
// closer; the cycle-1/2 rulings pinned in bug-aftercloser-orphan-silent
// and bug-aftercloser-duplicate-silent). With `Merge duplicate
// definitions` ON, mergeDuplicateFootnoteDefinitions groups only
// findDefinitionBlocks' column-0 blocks, so the closer-line copy is never
// merged - and noticeDuplicateDefinitions then returns early BECAUSE the
// toggle is on. The duplicate is neither fixed nor reported.
//
// ADR-0002 (never silent): every problem lint won't fix by itself is
// surfaced, naming the footnotes. With the toggle OFF this exact shape is
// reported (the fixed pins); turning the toggle ON makes the report stop
// while the fix stays impossible, the worst of both worlds.
//
// What the user sees: nothing, ever. Obsidian renders only the LAST of
// the two definitions (the duplicate rule, verified live 2026-08-12), so
// one of their definitions is silently dead text, and no lint run tells
// them which footnote or why.
//
// Source of truth: docs/adr/0002-never-silent-lint.md ("duplicates are
// never passed over in silence") + the merge rule's own contract that a
// closer-line definition is never merged (so the alert is the only
// outlet).
//
// Settings involved: `Merge duplicate definitions` ON.
