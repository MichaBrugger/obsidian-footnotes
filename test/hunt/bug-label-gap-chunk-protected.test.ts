// Imported from the glm-cycle-11 hunt of 2026-09-16 (OpenCode worktree); rewritten to the probed readings 2026-09-16.
// RESOLVED 2026-09-16 (GLM hunt cycle 11, probed in Reading view): under an indented code line or a two-line link reference definition the label opens a definition whose chunk after the blank gap is its live body (the scan now knows both as blocks of their own); under a quoted definition's label, continuation, or column-0 tail the chunk is CODE, as the scan already read it, so the block walker now leaves indented code where it is; under a quoted fence's content the label is swallowed by the fence.
// GLM 5.3 Flash cycle 11 hunt of 2026-09-16 (OpenCode worktree glm-cycle-11). 4 of 8 tests carry it.fails; the controls do not.

// BUG: a definition label that starts directly under a line which ends the
// block above it in Reading view but leaves the scan's own block state open
// does not open the scan's inDefinition state. The state machine re-decides
// `inDefinition` from the PREVIOUS line's blockBoundary (`inDefinition =
// DefinitionStart.test(src[i]) ? blockBoundary || inDefinition : ...`), and
// the previous line's blockBoundary is false for exactly the lines that DO
// end a block in Obsidian: a quoted definition's label line, its quoted
// continuation line, its column-0 lazy tail, an indented-code line (the
// indented-code branch sets blockBoundary = false), a two-line link
// reference definition's destination line, and the column-0 line that killed
// a quoted fence. So the indented chunk after the new definition's BLANK GAP
// - which the pinned control in bug-definition-chunk-after-ender records as
// the definition's live continuation ("a chunk after the definition's blank
// gap IS its continuation", scanDocument(["[^1]: body", "", "    chunk[^73]"])
// -> all false) - is read as INDENTED CODE (isProtected true).
//
// The plugin's own readers disagree about the very same lines:
// definitionStartLines says the label is a definition start (its own doc:
// "A label may start ... after a protected line (a fence closer, a comment,
// frontmatter, indented code)"), and findDefinitionBlocks absorbs the chunk
// into the block (blocks say 1-3) - while scanDocument.isProtected says the
// chunk is code. micromark agrees with the two live readers: "    code",
// "[^1]: body", "", "    chunk[^9]" parses as code("code") and then ONE
// footnoteDefinition holding two paragraphs - "body" and "chunk[^9]" - so
// the reference in the chunk is live.
//
// What the user would see: the "[^9]" they cite in their footnote's second
// paragraph is live in Reading view but invisible to the plugin - reindex
// skips it, the orphan and missing-definition alerts never name it, the
// numbered command hands its number out again, and the chunk-owning block's
// move by the first lint FLIPS the reference live and renumbers it (the
// conservation property's exact crime: one lint changed what is live).
//
// Source of truth: micromark oracle (one footnoteDefinition, two paragraphs)
// + the plugin's own pinned control (bug-definition-chunk-after-ender: a
// chunk after a definition's blank gap is its continuation) + the plugin's
// own definitionStartLines, which starts a definition under every line named
// above. Two readers in markdown-scan.ts disagree; the protected one loses.
//
// Settings involved: none for the scan; every rule and press guard inherits
// the misread (the first lint's move flips the reference live).
