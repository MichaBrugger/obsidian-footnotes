// SPEC QUESTION: a link reference definition whose destination line carries
// a title - "[foo]:" then "/url \"title\"".
//
// CommonMark 4.7 lets a link reference definition run over two lines, and
// the title may sit on the DESTINATION's line as well as on its own:
// "[foo]:" with "/url \"title\"" under it is one definition. The repo's
// micromark oracle parses it as definition(foo) + footnoteDefinition for
// the label under the pair. The plugin's two-line detection
// (definitionStartLines, the lrdDestinationNext branch) accepts the
// destination line only when it is a SINGLE token
// (/^\s*\S+\s*$/), so "/url \"title\"" is rejected, "[foo]:" alone reads as
// paragraph text, and the footnote label under the pair is judged LAZY.
//
// Reading view's answer for the BARE destination form is probed (GLM hunt
// cycle 6: Obsidian accepts "[foo]:" then "/url" as a two-line block, and
// the label under the pair is a definition), but the destination-with-
// title form was never probed, so this stays a question rather than a bug
// pin. The plugin already accepts a title on its OWN line (lrdTitle) and a
// title on the one-line form's destination; only the two-line form's
// combined line is missed.
//
// What the user would see if Reading view agrees with CommonMark: the
// footnote under such a pair renders, but the lazy-definition alert names
// it falsely ("Obsidian reads as plain text") and fix-lazy inserts a blank
// line the note never needed.
//
// Source of truth: CommonMark 4.7 (the title may follow the destination on
// the same line) + micromark/mdast. Settings involved: `Fix definitions
// hidden by a missing blank line` and its alert.
