// Imported from the Kimi K3 cycle 2 hunt of 2026-09-16 (OpenCode worktree); 3 of 4 tests carry it.fails: 0 were red there and marked on import, the rest the hunter marked itself.
// RESOLVED 2026-09-16: Reading view renders the two quoted lines as one code span (probed); the search now follows the paragraph's own quote depth.

// The scanner's cross-line code-span search stops at every line that
// STARTS a construct, because a construct ends the paragraph the span
// lives in: a fence, a heading, a rule, a blockquote marker (cycle 1
// pinned: "a `code\n> quoted" - the quote starts, the paragraph ends,
// the span dies unclosed).
//
// But a line whose ">" CONTINUES an already-open quote at the same depth
// is no construct: the quote's paragraph runs on, and a code span opened
// on the previous quoted line closes right there. CommonMark reads
// "> `code\n> span`" as blockquote > paragraph > one inlineCode node -
// verified against micromark for this hunt.
//
// The scanner stops at the ">" anyway, so the span never crosses and the
// [^1] inside it reads as a LIVE reference. That is text inside a code
// span, which Jason's 2026-08-10 ruling calls untouchable: it reserves a
// footnote number, it counts for reindex, and with `Delete orphaned
// references` ON the lint cuts it OUT of the code span.
//
// What the user sees: the code span in their blockquote renders
// correctly, but the plugin treats its [^1] as a footnote - the next
// real footnote skips a number, and the destructive lint setting edits
// the code.
//
// Source of truth: CommonMark's lazy paragraph continuation inside a
// blockquote via micromark as run for this hunt + the cycle-1 pin for
// the quote-STARTS case (test/hunt's code-span blockquote coverage).
//
// Settings involved: `Delete orphaned references` (the destructive
// half), the default numbering and reindex for the rest.
