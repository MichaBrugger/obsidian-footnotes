// RESOLVED 2026-09-16: Reading view agrees with micromark on every shape below (probed), so the scan's search for a code span's closer now stops at each of these block starts; the pins pass.

// spec question: when a code span's opening backtick run sits on one line
// and a block-level construct that ENDS the paragraph stands between it
// and the next backtick run, does the span reach across the interrupt, or
// does it die at the paragraph's end?
//
// CommonMark's answer (verified against micromark 2026-09-16, this hunt):
// the paragraph ends, the opener never closes, and both backtick runs are
// literal text - so a "[^2]" after the opener is a LIVE reference (in a
// setext heading it renders as a footnote sup inside the heading,
// verified in micromark's HTML output). The constructs that end a
// paragraph here: a setext underline of one or more "=" or "-" signs, a
// blockquote opener, a bullet list item, an ordered list item numbered 1,
// and an HTML block opener such as "<!--".
//
// The plugin's scanner disagrees: closesAhead (markdown-scan.ts) looks for
// the closing run on later lines and stops only at a blank line, a fence,
// an ATX heading, or a 3+ character thematic break. It searches straight
// through every one of the constructs above, so it masks from the opener
// to the next same-length run across the interrupt, and the "[^2]" dies
// inside the mask.
//
// What the user would see if Reading view matches CommonMark: the heading
// text "My `note [^2]" shows a footnote marker on "[^2]", but the plugin
// treats it as dead code - the numbered command mints a duplicate "[^2]",
// reindex renumbers around it, and orphan deletion erases references that
// Reading view shows as live.
//
// The catch: B30 (2026-09-16) ruled that for code spans across lines the
// oracle is Reading view, not Live Preview and not micromark, and sheet 11
// records only the plain-paragraph case ("a run of the same length closes
// it further down ... within the paragraph"). Whether Reading view also
// ends the span's paragraph at these constructs is NOT recorded anywhere.
//
// NEEDS A LIVE CHECK: in Reading view, does "`code [^2]" followed by "==="
// render as a heading whose "[^2]" is a live footnote reference? If yes,
// every case below is a bug; if no, the plugin's masking is right and
// these pins flip.
//
// Source of truth: CommonMark 0.31 (code spans may span line endings
// within a paragraph; a setext underline, blockquote, list, or HTML block
// ends the paragraph) as implemented by micromark, run as this repo's
// oracle. Settings involved: none (scanner facts drive every feature).
