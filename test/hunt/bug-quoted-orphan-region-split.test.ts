// A definition block OWNS a region one of its lines opens: the column-0
// walk (findDefinitionBlocks) absorbs the interior and closer lines of a
// comment, math block, or fence opened on a continuation line, "so the
// definition owns all of it" (markdown-scan.ts) - a rule added after
// whole-block deletions "took the opener away from its closer" (Claude
// sweep 2026-09-13). The QUOTED walk, quotedDefinitionEnd, never got that
// memo: it stops at the region's first protected interior line, so the
// block ends early.
//
// When the orphaned-definition rule then cuts the quoted block, the
// comment's (or math block's) opener goes with it but the interior and
// closer stay behind - and with the opener gone the interior turns into
// LIVE text. Reference-shaped text the user had hidden inside a comment
// wakes up as a live reference.
//
// What the user sees, with `Delete orphaned definitions` ON: lint deletes
// their orphaned quoted definition, and where it stood there is now
// "> hidden [^9]" and a dangling ">" closer line, rendered as ordinary
// text - the comment they wrote is dismembered around the deletion.
//
// Source of truth: the rule's own contract ("Protected text, and
// everything that is referenced, stays exactly where it is",
// remove-orphaned-definitions.ts) and the column-0 precedent in
// findDefinitionBlocks (a definition owns the regions its lines open,
// verified in Reading view 2026-09-16 per the code comment).
//
// Settings involved: `Delete orphaned definitions` ON (non-default).
