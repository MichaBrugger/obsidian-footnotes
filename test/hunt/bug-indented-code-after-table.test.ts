// A GFM table is a leaf block: it cannot be continued, lazily or
// otherwise, so the line after its last row starts a NEW block. An
// indented chunk there opens at a block boundary, which makes it
// CommonMark indented CODE - reference-shaped text inside it is dead.
//
// The plugin's own scanner agrees everywhere else: blockBoundary opens
// after "a '#' heading, a closed fence, a bare region closer, or a
// thematic break" (markdown-scan.ts, case C21). And it agrees for the
// LABEL rule: definitionStartLines ends the block at a table row so a
// label directly under a table is a definition (Jason's ruling A2,
// 2026-09-15, pinned). But the indented-code half never learned about
// tables: after "| --- |" the scanner still thinks a paragraph is open,
// so the chunk reads as a lazy paragraph continuation and the [^1]
// inside it is LIVE.
//
// What the user sees: the dead [^1] reserves a number (their next real
// footnote skips one), the missing-definition alert nags about text that
// is sitting inside a code block, and with `Delete orphaned references`
// ON the lint cuts the [^1] OUT of the code block - Jason's ruling
// 2026-08-10 is "lint never touches code", and it does.
//
// Source of truth: GFM's table extension (a table is a leaf block that
// breaks at the start of another block-level structure; an indented
// chunk after it is indented code) + the plugin's own table-row handling
// in definitionStartLines (the A2 ruling: the row ends the block).
// Residual uncertainty about Reading view's exact table+cache behavior
// is noted; the internal inconsistency (label rule vs indent rule
// disagreeing) is visible either way.
//
// Settings involved: `Delete orphaned references` for the destructive
// half; the default numbering and alerts for the rest.
