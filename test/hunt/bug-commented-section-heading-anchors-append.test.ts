// BUG: a section heading the user has commented out with "%%" still acts as
// the anchor for footnote definitions, so the plugin writes inside the
// comment block.
//
// What the user would see: in a note whose only "# Footnotes" line sits
// inside a "%%" comment, with the section heading setting turned on,
// creating the first footnote puts the new definition inside that comment.
// Obsidian hides it, so the footnote renders as plain text and the next
// lint run reports its reference as an orphan. The move-to-bottom rule has
// the same blind spot from the other direction: it gathers the note's one
// definition in under the commented-out heading, which also breaks the
// comment into pieces.
//
// Why it happens: the shared heading finder, findLineRunEnd, only refuses a
// line that is protected. A "%%" comment line is deliberately left
// unprotected so that references inside it still bind their definitions, so
// nothing in that search ever asks whether the line is inside a comment
// block. An HTML-commented heading IS protected and is correctly skipped,
// which is the green control at the bottom of this file.
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13. Lens: comments.
// Source of truth: manual sheet 18 line ~118 ("nothing is inserted or moved
// inside either %% block"); attack-surface "%% comments" row ("nothing
// inside a block comment is moved, renamed, or fixed; the definition append
// never lands inside an unclosed block").
