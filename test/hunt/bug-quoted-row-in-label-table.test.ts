// A table that starts ON a definition's label line ("[^1]: | a | b |")
// belongs to the footnote, its column-0 rows included (pinned in Reading
// view, cycle 3). findDefinitionBlocks absorbs those rows through
// columnZeroRow, which checks indent, labels and pipes - but not
// BLOCKQUOTE MARKERS. A quoted row ("> | c | d |") is not a column-0 row:
// a blockquote line cannot lazily continue a table (lazy continuation
// applies to paragraphs only), so in Reading view it interrupts the table
// and sits OUTSIDE the footnote, as a top-level blockquote - the same rule
// that makes the walker's own lazyContinuation reject every ">"-prefixed
// line under a definition body.
//
// The block walker swallows the quoted line anyway, so the definition
// block reaches one line past the table. The orphaned-definition rule
// then CUTS it: with `Delete orphaned definitions` on, an unreferenced
// "[^1]" takes the user's blockquote line with it - text Obsidian never
// rendered as part of the footnote, eaten by a rule whose promise is that
// only the definition goes. move-to-bottom drags the quoted line along
// too (harmless-looking, but it relocates a line that was never the
// footnote's).
//
// What the user sees: their quoted table row disappears from the note
// when the lint deletes an orphaned definition above it. ADR 0002's
// guarantee (deletion only takes what the rule names) is broken by the
// extent, not by the toggle.
//
// Source of truth: CommonMark container rules (a blockquote cannot
// lazily continue a table; at column 0 it is a top-level block outside
// the definition) + the plugin's own lazyContinuation, which rejects
// ">" lines under a definition body for exactly this reason + the
// pinned column-0-rows ruling, whose rows carry no quote markers.
//
// Settings involved: `Delete orphaned definitions` ON (the cut); the
// extent itself affects move-to-bottom at any setting.
