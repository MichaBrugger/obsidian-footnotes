// BUG (turns body prose into an h2): "prose\n---" is a setext H2. Removing or
// moving the definition line(s) that sat between a paragraph line and a "---"
// (or "___" / "***") line drops the paragraph directly onto the divider,
// silently rewriting it into a heading. Both removeLineRanges (used by reindex's
// orphan cut and by move-to-bottom) and move-to-bottom's re-layout only collapse
// doubled blank lines; neither checks what its cut leaves adjacent.
// Scenario: cutting/moving a definition strands a paragraph atop a "---" -> setext heading.
// fixed 2026-07-17: removeLineRanges reinstates a blank line when a cut would
// drop a paragraph directly onto a "---"/"===" setext underline.
// Provenance: iteration-1/eval-0/without_skill/run-1 (transform bug hunt, Bug 2).
