// Scenario: a code fence opened with one space of indent is closed by a line
// indented four spaces, which is too deep to be a closer. Everything after
// it is then treated as ordinary text when it is still code.
//
// What the user would see: in a note that reads
//    ```
//   aaa[^1]
//       ```
//   bbb[^2]
// (the opener carrying one space of indent, the would-be closer carrying
// four) the plugin thinks the code block has ended. So "bbb[^2]" is read as
// a live reference even though Obsidian still shows it as code. Lint will
// renumber and rewrite inside the code block, and creating a new footnote
// hands out 3 instead of 1.
//
// The cause: when a fence opens at the document level, contentIndent is
// computed as the opener's own indent, so the closer is allowed to sit at
// the opener's indent plus three. CommonMark measures those three spaces
// from the document margin, not from the opener.
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13. Lens: contexts.
//
// Source of truth: CommonMark 0.31.2 section 4.5, "The closing code fence
// may be indented up to three spaces, and its indentation need not match
// that of the opening fence", together with the four-space-closer example
// printed right after it (example 107). Checked against micromark: the
// four-space line stays part of the code block's content.
