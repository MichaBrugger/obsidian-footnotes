// A bare-prefix placeholder ("[^3.]" in a note whose prefix is "3.") is a
// footnote the user is still naming - "an in-progress footnote owned by
// the user's typing, never deleted out from under them" (CONTEXT.md), and
// the unnamed-reference alert counts it as unfilled exactly like "[^]"
// (former sheet 23). Orphan deletion already leaves it alone (orphanSafePrefix).
// Reindex does not: with `Renumber named footnotes` ON, "3." is a NAME
// like any other, so the placeholder is renumbered to "[^3.1]" - the
// user never typed the "1", the placeholder is gone, and the alert that
// should keep reminding them about it falls silent on the post-lint text.
//
// What the user sees: they planted "[^3.]" to name in a moment, pressed
// save with lint-on-save, and the placeholder silently became "[^3.1]";
// the alert that was supposed to remind them it is unfinished never
// fires again. When they come back and type "smith" they get "[^3.1smith]"
// - a footnote, but not the one they meant, and nobody told them.
//
// Source of truth: CONTEXT.md's placeholder contract + former sheet 23's
// "counts as unfilled exactly like [^]" (the alert must keep speaking,
// which it cannot once the placeholder is renamed away) + the
// orphanSafePrefix precedent (deletion already exempts it; renumbering
// is the same class of touch).
//
// Settings involved: `Reindex` ON (default) + `Renumber named footnotes`
// ON + a per-note prefix.
