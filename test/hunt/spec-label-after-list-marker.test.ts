// Imported from the Kimi K3 cycle 3 hunt of 2026-09-16 (OpenCode worktree); 2 of 3 tests carry it.fails: 0 were red there and marked on import, the rest the hunter marked itself.
// VERIFIED IN READING VIEW 2026-09-16, NOT YET FIXED: "- [^a]: def", "1. [^a]: def", and "> - [^a]: def" all render as definitions; a lazy line under the marker line joins the footnote, a following "- item" does not, and a continuation indented to the item's content column plus four does. Same scope question as bug-list-item-label-margin: waits for Jason's ruling.

// SPEC QUESTION: "- [^a]: def" - a footnote label written directly after
// a list item's marker, on the marker's own line. A definition, or a list
// item holding a live "[^a]" reference?
//
// micromark parses a footnoteDefinition inside the listItem (GFM:
// footnote definitions can occur anywhere block-level content is allowed,
// and a list item's content is block-level; the label starts the item's
// content, it does not interrupt anything). The plugin's label reader
// never strips a list marker, so the line reads as an ordinary item whose
// "[^a]" is a live reference pointing at nothing: the missing-definition
// alert nags, and the hotkey on it APPENDS a second "[^a]:" definition at
// the bottom (Obsidian then renders only the last, if it saw the first at
// all).
//
// Why this is a spec question and not a bug pin: sheet 25's rule (the
// Obsidian-specific one) covers labels UNDER prose lines, and its
// definition-start allowance list does not mention a list marker's line;
// the marker-line shape is unprobed in Reading view. The after-blank
// in-item twin (bug-list-item-label-margin) IS pinned as a bug because
// sheet 25 explicitly allows a label after a blank line and the only
// thing in the way there is the indent margin.
//
// NEEDS A LIVE CHECK: in Reading view, does "- [^a]: def" render as a
// footnote definition (superscript on "use[^a]" and an entry at the
// bottom), or as a list item whose text reads "[^a]: def"?
//
// Source of truth if Reading view agrees with micromark: the label after
// a list marker must count as a definition start, the reference must
// bind, and no rule may treat the line as plain item text. Settings
// involved: every definition-driven rule; the creation press inherits it
// through listExistingFootnoteDefinitions.
