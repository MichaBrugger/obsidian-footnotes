// spec question: should these two helpers be total functions, answering for
// any input they are handed, or is out-of-range input outside their
// contract, so that a caller who hands them nonsense gets whatever happens?
//
// Reading one, total: a helper that takes an offset or a range should cope
// with one that does not fit the text, because the offsets it is handed come
// from a live editor. A caret can be reported past the end of the text it
// belongs to: that is exactly why cellCaret exists to clamp one (sheet 06,
// 2026-09-11), and the #39 null-deref class says a stale caret must not
// crash the press that reads it. On this reading endOfWordOffset should give
// the offset back untouched, the way its twin startOfWordOffset already
// does, and simulateChanges should refuse a range whose end comes before its
// start rather than invent text.
//
// Reading two, by contract: both functions are internal helpers with one
// caller each, every caller clamps its offsets before calling, and no caller
// can build a reversed range. On this reading the current behaviour is
// nobody's problem and the cost of making them total is code that can never
// run.
//
// What the user would see today: nothing. Both are latent. No press reaches
// either function with input of this shape, so these are questions about
// what the helpers promise, not reports of something breaking.
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13. Lens: offsets.
//
// Source of truth: startOfWordOffset's own behaviour on the same input (it
// returns the offset unchanged) as the sibling contract endOfWordOffset is
// measured against; and @codemirror/state's ChangeSet, which throws on a
// range whose end is before its start, as the referee the simulation is
// written to match (test/simulate-changes-differential.test.ts uses the very
// same referee).
