// What a user sees: in a note with a fenced code block inside a blockquote
// inside a list item ("- > ```"), the fence is not detected: code inside it
// is treated as live text, so the next "Insert footnote" skips numbers the
// code only happens to contain (here it mints [^100] instead of [^2]), and
// a definition-shaped line inside the code is listed as a real definition.
//
// Root cause: scanDocument's fence-opener check strips a list marker from
// the line and then tries the fence pattern on what is left - but what is
// left can still carry a blockquote marker ("> ```"), which the pattern
// does not accept. The container walk composes quote-inside-list the other
// way ("> - ```" works, and "> > ```" works), so this one nesting order
// falls through. A mutation of the container-fence class one level deeper
// than the pins (bug-list-item-fence covered "- ```").
