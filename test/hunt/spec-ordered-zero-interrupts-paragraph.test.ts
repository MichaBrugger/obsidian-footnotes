// spec question: does an ordered list item numbered "01" (or "001")
// interrupt a paragraph in Obsidian's Reading view?
//
// CommonMark parses the ordered-list start NUMBER as an integer, and the
// rule is that a list can interrupt a paragraph only when that number is
// 1. "01." parses to 1, so in CommonMark "para\n01. item" is a paragraph
// and then a list. The plugin's paragraphGoesOn - the check that decides
// whether a code span or a comment/math region opened in one paragraph
// may close in a later line of it - stops only at a literal "1[.)]" list
// marker, so it lets the span run straight past a "01." line.
//
// The consequence: in "a `code\n01. [^1] x\nspan`" the plugin kills the
// reference (the span covers it) where CommonMark leaves it live (the
// list starts, the span dies with the paragraph). A cross-line comment or
// math region's lookahead has the same shape.
//
// NEEDS A LIVE CHECK: whether Reading view starts a list at "01." under a
// paragraph (Obsidian usually normalizes ordered markers, but whether it
// lets one interrupt a paragraph is not recorded anywhere). If it does,
// the plugin's span/region lookaheads run one line too far.
//
// Source of truth: CommonMark 5.2 (the start number is an integer;
// paragraph interruption turns on its value), against the plugin's
// literal "1[.)]" pattern. micromark is the oracle for the CommonMark
// side only - Obsidian's own reading is the unrecorded half.
