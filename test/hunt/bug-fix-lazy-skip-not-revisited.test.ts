// The fix-lazy rule walks its lazy labels topmost first, inserting one
// blank line at a time, and SKIPS a label whose blank would reclassify
// protected text below it (the swallow guard). The skip verdict depends
// on the CURRENT state of the note - and the rule's own insertions change
// that state. A label skipped early is never revisited, even after a
// LATER insertion in the same run makes its blank line safe.
//
// Here: inserting [^3]'s blank closes the open list item, which strands
// [^21]'s indented continuation as indented code - while [^21] is still
// lazy. So [^3] is skipped. But the same run then fixes [^21], whose
// continuation is now a definition's content and no longer code. The
// second run inserts [^3]'s blank without trouble - so fixLazy twice
// changes what fixLazy once produced, and the pinned invariant
// "fixLazyDefinitions on its own is idempotent" (test/properties.test.ts)
// breaks.
//
// What the user sees: with the fix toggle ON, the lazy label stays prose
// after the first lint (the alert nags about it); only a SECOND lint
// heals it. Anything downstream of the definition count - orphans,
// duplicates, reindex - sees the note change between runs.
//
// Source of truth: the idempotence invariant pinned for this very rule
// in test/properties.test.ts ("fixLazyDefinitions on its own is
// idempotent") + the rule's own contract (insert the one blank line a
// hidden definition needs).
//
// Settings involved: `Fix definitions hidden by a missing blank line` ON
// (the default).
