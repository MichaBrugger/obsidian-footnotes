// SPEC QUESTIONS, not confirmed bugs: shapes where micromark (CommonMark
// 0.31) and the plugin's scanner disagree about whether text is dead, and
// the manual sheets do not record what Obsidian's Reading view does. Each
// needs a live check before it can be called a bug.
//
// (1) An HTML block of type 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6 INSIDE a container. Cycle 1
// probed those types at the DOCUMENT level in Reading view (dead text,
// pinned). Inside a blockquote or a list item the plugin's check is
// skipped ("Document level only", markdown-scan.ts), so a "[^x]:" label
// behind the tag is a lazy label with a live reference. CommonMark (via
// micromark) reads the tag's block INSIDE the container and the label is
// raw HTML. The comment type (type 2) IS handled inside quotes by the
// same scanner, which makes the omission look accidental rather than
// chosen.
//
// What the user would see if Reading view matches micromark: the
// lazy-definition alert advises a blank line above a label that is raw
// HTML inside the tag (the advice happens to heal it, by ending the
// tag's block - but for the wrong reason), and the missing-definition
// alert is avoided only by the lazy-label exemption's accident.
//
// (2) An HTML block of TYPE 7 at all: a complete open or closing tag
// alone on its line that is not in CommonMark's type-6 tag list
// ("<custom-el>"). micromark reads it as an HTML block (it cannot
// interrupt a paragraph, so at a block boundary it opens); the plugin
// has no type-7 handling at all, so the label behind it is a lazy label
// with a live reference. Cycle 1 explicitly scoped types 1,3,4,5,6 and
// left type 7 unprobed.
//
// Source of truth (if a live check confirms them): CommonMark 0.31's
// HTML-block rules via micromark, as run for this hunt.
//
// Settings involved: `Delete orphaned references`, `Fix definitions
// hidden by a missing blank line` and the two alerts.
