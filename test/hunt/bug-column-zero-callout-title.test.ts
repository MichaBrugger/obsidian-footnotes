// BUG: an ordinary paragraph line that happens to begin with "[!" is mistaken
// for a callout title, so a label on the next line is called a real
// definition when Obsidian reads it as plain paragraph text.
//
// The check that spots a callout title strips the "> " blockquote markers off
// the front of the line and then tests what is left, without ever checking
// that there were any markers to strip. At column 0 that makes "[!note] not a
// callout" look like a callout title, and so does the shields-style badge
// line "[![badge](img.svg)](https://ci.example)", which is an image inside a
// link and matches the same shape.
//
// What the user would see: the footnote silently does not render. Because the
// plugin believes the label is a real definition, nothing is reported, and
// with Move definitions to bottom switched off the fix-lazy rule adds no
// blank line, so nothing tells the user why their footnote is missing. That
// silence is exactly what the never-silent policy exists to prevent. Worse,
// with Delete orphaned definitions switched ON, a label under a badge line
// that nothing references is taken for an orphaned definition and deleted:
// visible prose disappears from the note.
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13. Lens: the prose-label rule (attack-surface row 1).
//
// Source of truth: Obsidian's callout syntax, where a callout is a blockquote
// whose first line is "[!type]"; there is no such thing as a column-0
// callout. Manual sheet 14's control c4 is the real shape, "> [!note]" then
// "> [^c4]:".
