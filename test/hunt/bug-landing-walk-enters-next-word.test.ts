// BUG: the end-of-word walk hops an apostrophe or a full stop without
// looking at what comes next, so it can stop in the middle of a word.
//
// What the user would see, pressing the numbered hotkey with the caret
// inside the first half of the word:
//   I don't worry        becomes   I don'[^1]t worry
//   the U.S. said        becomes   the U.[^1]S. said
//   visit example.com    becomes   visit example.[^1]com
// and linting an existing note does the same to prose it never should
// have touched:
//   Marx[^1]'s theory    becomes   Marx'[^1]s theory
//   the U[^1].S. said    becomes   the U.[^1]S. said
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13. Lens: the landing convention.
//
// Source of truth:
//  - CONTEXT.md, "End-of-word adjustment": moving an insertion point to
//    the end of the word "(and past trailing punctuation) under the
//    caret, so mid-word presses don't split words".
//  - README, line ~166: the setting "places the reference at the end of
//    the word, past any closing quotation marks, brackets, or emphasis
//    and the punctuation after them, so you don't have to aim".
//  - TrailingPunctuationChars' own description in markdown-scan.ts: the
//    class is TRAILING punctuation, which an apostrophe or a full stop in
//    the middle of a word is not.
//
// WHAT IS PINNED HERE, and what deliberately is not: the exact landing is
// Jason's ruling and two readings are still open. One says the walk should
// resume over the rest of the word ("don't" to 5, "U.S." to 8); the other
// says it should stop BEFORE a mark that has a word character after it,
// which is what keeps lint from touching "Marx[^1]'s" at all. The two give
// different offsets, so this file asserts only the part both agree on: the
// landing is never between a mark and a word character.
//
// Scope: the table-cell path is endOfWordOffset itself, so those cases are
// certain. The main-editor press below runs on the fake editor's word
// lookup, so it additionally assumes Obsidian's wordAt does not include
// the apostrophe (that matches CodeMirror's default word characters, and
// is worth one live check in the real app).
//
// Note the commoner press is already fine: with the caret AFTER the
// apostrophe, the walk starts past it and lands at the end of the word.
