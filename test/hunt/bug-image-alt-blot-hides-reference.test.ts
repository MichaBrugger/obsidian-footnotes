// RESOLVED 2026-09-16 (GLM hunt cycle 9, all four shapes probed in Reading view: the footnote renders beside the image, the math, the code span, and the closed comment). The image's alt blot is kept apart in the reference-shape index and counts only for questions asked past its start.

// BUG (GLM hunt cycle 13, 2026-09-16): the image-alt pre-blot in
// maskLineRegions runs BEFORE the scan head reaches anything, and it feeds
// the same blot() that drives ReferenceShapeIndex.lastBlotted. The index's
// own contract ("Every blot so far lies behind i") is thereby broken: after
// an image on the line, lastBlotted sits AHEAD of the head, so inside(i)
// returns false for every reference opener the image sits after. A "$", a
// backtick, or a "<!--" inside such a reference's NAME is then no longer
// recognized as name text, opens the construct it looks like, and the
// construct's blot range covers the reference's own "]" - the reference
// disappears from the masked twin.
//
// Obsidian reads the bracket construct first, so a "$" inside a reference
// is name text that never opens math (Jason verified live 2026-08-10; the
// scanner's own documented rule), a backtick inside a name is footnote-id
// text (sheet 23: "[^aa`a] [^bb#b] [^cc`c]" renders three footnotes), and
// "[^a<!--b]" renders as a live footnote (Kimi sweep 2026-09-13, verified
// in Reading view). An image's alt text is dead, but only the ALT is
// (cycle 8): the reference after the image must stay live.
//
// What the user sees: the reference renders in Reading view, but the
// plugin cannot see it. With `Delete orphaned definitions` ON, the lint
// judges "[^a$b]: def" unreferenced and EATS it while the superscript
// still renders. With the toggle off, the orphaned-definition alert names
// it falsely on every lint. Reindex, apply-prefix, and rename all skip the
// invisible reference, so a renumbered definition stops pairing with it.
//
// Source of truth: the plugin's own recorded Reading-view probes (the
// dollar-in-name and comment-in-name verifications cited above) + the
// ReferenceShapeIndex invariant stated at
// src/parsing/markdown-scan.ts ("Every blot so far lies behind i"), which
// the image pre-blot violates.
//
// Settings involved: `Delete orphaned definitions` (the eating), Reindex
// and `Renumber named footnotes` (the skipped reference).
