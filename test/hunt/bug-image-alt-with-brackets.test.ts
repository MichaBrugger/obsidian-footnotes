// Imported from the glm-cycle-10 hunt of 2026-09-16 (OpenCode worktree); all pins flipped green 2026-09-16 after the fix.
// RESOLVED 2026-09-16 (GLM hunt cycle 10, both alt shapes probed in Reading view: an embed and no footnote). The alt blot now finds the bracket that balances the opener.
// GLM hunt cycle 10, 2026-09-16.
//
// Scenario: an image whose ALT TEXT holds a bracketed footnote reference:
//
//     see ![alt[^1]](url)
//
//     [^1]: one
//
// What Reading view shows (probed, GLM cycle 3, recorded in
// spec-image-alt-reference.test.ts): an embed with alt "alt^1" and NO
// footnote - the alt is stringified, its reference never resolves, and no
// definition entry renders. micromark agrees (probed for this hunt: the
// document parses to <img alt="alt^1"/> and no footnote section).
//
// The scan leaves the reference LIVE. The image-alt blot in
// maskLineRegions matches an alt with /!\[([^[\]\n]*)\]\(/ - a group that
// cannot contain brackets - so an alt that CONTAINS the reference's own
// "[^1]" never matches it, and no other masking path claims the text (a
// link's "]" branch blots only the destination; the "[[" branch needs two
// opening brackets). The cycle-3 probe covered exactly the bracketed
// shape "![alt[^1]](url)" and settled it dead.
//
// What the user sees: the footnote takes a number in reindex as if it
// rendered, the missing-definition alert asks for a definition for text
// that never shows one, an alt-only reference keeps a definition alive
// under Delete orphaned definitions, and a press inside the alt text
// mints a footnote that is dead on arrival (the born-dead check reads
// the same live mask and lets it through).
//
// Source of truth: the cycle-3 Reading-view probe recorded in
// spec-image-alt-reference.test.ts + micromark 4.0 output for the exact
// document + the blot's own contract (the same file already blots a
// bracket-free alt).
//
// Settings involved: none (the scan feeds every rule and every press).
