// Scenario: the SAME footnote name defined TWICE - once in a definition
// whose label follows a "%%" block comment's closer on its line
// ("%% [^d]: first body" - a real definition, Jason's verification
// 2026-09-15, sheet 11), and once in an ordinary column-0 definition.
//
// What the user sees: Obsidian renders only the LAST definition of a name
// (ground truth recorded in merge-duplicate-definitions.ts: "Every earlier
// one is dead text that disappears without a word"), so the note's "first
// body" silently disappears from Reading view. The user opted into the
// never-silent posture (ADR 0002: every problem the lint won't fix is
// surfaced as an alert, never passed over in silence), so lint should name
// the duplicate - exactly as it names an ORPHAN whose label sits on a
// closer line, which scanReferences deliberately reports as a block
// ("an orphan the rule will not delete is named, never passed over in
// silence (ADR 2)").
//
// What the plugin does: both the duplicate alert and the merge rule read
// only findDefinitionBlocks, and a closer-line label never forms one (its
// line starts with "%%", so DefinitionStart does not match and the line can
// never be cut). The orphan alerts see closer-line labels because they push
// quoted labels themselves; the duplicate alert does not. Result: with
// Merge OFF the lint is completely silent about the pair (checked via the
// notice recorder), and with Merge ON the note comes back byte for byte
// unchanged - the first body disappears in Reading view either way, and no
// lint ever says why.
//
// Source of truth: ADR 0002 ("every content-destroying fix is surfaced as a
// lint alert instead... duplicate definitions alert rather than merge") +
// the recorded ground truth that a closer-line label defines its footnote
// (bug-aftercloser-orphan-silent's own header) + former sheet 23's duplicate
// section ("an alert says [^dup] is defined more than once"). The
// documented carve-out for BLOCKQUOTED duplicates (C22: merging would need
// quote-marker-aware continuations) does not cover the closer line, which
// the orphan alert already treats as alertable. Settings involved:
// `Merge duplicate definitions` OFF (its default) for the alert; ON for the
// merge check.
