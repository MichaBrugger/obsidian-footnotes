// BUG: the repo has TWO table readers, and after Kimi hunt cycle 3 they
// disagree. tableRowLinesOf (the scanner's, used by definitionStartLines
// and the in-table alert) learned the Reading-view rule "a table cannot
// interrupt a paragraph - a table header directly under plain paragraph
// text or a list item line is no table at all" (Kimi hunt cycle 3, probed
// in Reading view 2026-09-16; the markdown-scan header even claims "The
// same rule as tableRowLines in the editor's table module"). tableRowLines
// (the editor's, in table-cursor.ts, used by the caret guards in
// press-guards.ts and the selection verdicts in selection-footnote.ts)
// never learned it: it marks the pipe run a table from the delimiter row
// alone, whatever sits above.
//
// So on a note where pipe-shaped prose sits directly under a paragraph
// line (a shell flag table typed mid-prose, say), which Reading view
// renders as ONE paragraph of literal pipes - no table, no cell editor,
// nothing to protect - the plugin:
//
//   - refuses the numbered/named/inline press with the caret on the
//     "| --- |" line ("the caret is on the row of dashes under a table's
//     header" - false: there is no table and no header),
//   - refuses a press past a row's closing pipe with the table-edge
//     notice,
//   - and refuses a selection running from inside the pipe run into the
//     text below as "cutting through a table's pipes", where the README
//     promises multi-paragraph selections convert.
//
// Source of truth: the recorded Reading-view probe (bug-table-under-lt-
// line's header, cycle 3: the run under plain paragraph text is no table)
// + tableRowLinesOf, which already implements it + markdown-scan.ts's own
// comment claiming the two readers share one rule. Caveat recorded
// honestly: these guards also serve Live Preview's table sub-editor, and
// no sheet records Live Preview's rendering of this shape; Reading view
// is the stated oracle, and there the run is a paragraph.
//
// Settings involved: every creation press's caret guards (the numbered,
// named, and inline keys) and the selection-to-footnote conversion.
