// spec question: what does the view a lint rule is handed promise about the
// arrays inside it - that they are the rule's own to scribble on, or that
// they are shared and must be left alone?
//
// While one outer lint is running, rewriteDocument keeps the pieces it
// worked out for a document (the scan, the masked twin, the definition
// starts, the definition blocks) in a one-entry memo, so the next rule that
// receives the identical text starts from them instead of scanning again.
// The memo is copied shallowly, which means the arrays themselves are the
// same objects, not copies. It also publishes pieces that were derived from
// the `lines` array a rule was given. So a rule that changes any of those
// arrays in place changes what the NEXT rule sees for the same text.
//
// Reading one, write the contract down: the view is shared, read-only, and a
// rule that needs to change a line makes its own copy. Cheap, and it is what
// every rule already does.
//
// Reading two, make it true: freeze the arrays (or hand out copies) so a
// rule that scribbles on one cannot poison the next view, and the memo is an
// optimisation nobody has to know about.
//
// What the user would see: nothing today. This is latent - no rule in the
// pipeline changes any of these arrays in place, all eight were checked - so
// it is a trap for a rule written later, not a report of something breaking.
// If a rule ever did, the next rule would work from a description of a
// document that does not exist, which is how definitions get moved to
// nowhere or dropped.
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13. Lens: the rule catalogue (the shared document view).
//
// Source of truth: DocumentView's own declaration, where every array is
// `readonly lines: string[]` and the one allowed change to `lines` is
// spelled out as trimTrailingBlankLines ("This is the ONE change to `lines`
// that is allowed"); and the memo's comment, "The memo is keyed on the exact
// text, so a rule that changed anything gets a fresh scan as before. The
// rules themselves are untouched."
