// A `[^x]:` label that sits BEFORE the `%%` on a block comment's closer
// line is inside the comment: the block runs from its opener through the
// first `%%` on a later line, so everything ahead of that closer is
// comment text, and the definition there is dead. The scanner knows this
// (definitionStartLines starts nothing on that line), and the rules leave
// the line alone. But the commented-definition alert skips EVERY closer
// line outright (`commentBlockCloseAt[i] >= 0` continues), on the reasoning
// that the text AFTER a closer is live - which says nothing about the text
// BEFORE it. So a dead definition the user wrote is neither reported nor
// fixable by any rule, on every lint, silently.
//
// What the user sees: `%%\n[^1]: def %%` renders no footnote (the
// definition is hidden inside the comment), and the lint never tells them
// their definition is commented out. Worse, when the note references
// `[^1]`, the alert they DO get is the missing-definition one ("Write its
// definition or delete the reference") - the wrong advice, since they
// already wrote the definition; it is just hidden.
//
// Source of truth: manual sheet 18 ("a definition inside a `%%` block
// comment is dead"; a block runs "through the next `%%` anywhere"), the
// commented-definition alert's own contract (lint-alerts.ts: definitions
// "written inside a `%%` block comment... the lint names it", Jason's
// ruling A1, 2026-09-15), and ADR-0002 (lint is never silent about
// problems it won't fix). The closer-line skip exists so that a label
// AFTER the closer ("%% [^3]: def", live per Jason's verification
// 2026-09-15) is not falsely reported - the label BEFORE the closer is
// the case that skip over-covers.
//
// Settings involved: none; the commented-definition alert always speaks
// when it has something to say.
