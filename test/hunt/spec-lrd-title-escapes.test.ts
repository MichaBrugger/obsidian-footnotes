// PROBED 2026-09-16 (GLM hunt cycle 7): an escaped quote in the title line breaks the whole link reference definition in Obsidian (one paragraph, label lazy), so that claim is refuted; a quoted title line under a column-0 definition is the quote's own paragraph and the label under it is lazy, so that claim holds and definitionStartLines now requires the title at the definition's depth.

// SPEC QUESTION (GLM 5.3 Flash cycle 11 hunt, 2026-09-16): which LRD
// title lines does Obsidian's link-reference-definition parser accept?
// definitionStartLines consumes a title line above a footnote label with
// the regex /^ {0,3}(?:"[^"]*"|'[^']*'|\([^)]*\))\s*$/ - no backslash
// escapes inside the quotes, no nested parentheses in the paren form, and
// no check that the title line sits at the link reference definition's
// own container depth. Three refinements of the two-line-LRD shape pinned
// in bug-label-under-multiline-lrd (title on the next line, probed in
// Reading view) are therefore unmodelled, and the label under each is
// judged LAZY where CommonMark consumes the title and shows the label as
// a definition (micromark oracle):
//
//   1. an escaped quote inside a double-quoted title: [foo]: /url over
//      "a \" b" - CommonMark consumes it as the title, so the label under
//      starts a definition; the plugin's regex stops at the escaped quote
//      and calls the label lazy.
//   2. a title line at a DIFFERENT container depth: [foo]: /url then
//      > "title" then a column-0 label. The title cannot cross the quote,
//      so the quote is its own block, the label under it is a lazy
//      continuation - and the plugin still consumes the quoted line as
//      the title and starts a definition at the label.
//   3. the nested-paren title (a(b)) - micromark REFUSES that one as a
//      title (the line stays a paragraph), and the plugin agrees by
//      accident; pinned as a control.
//
// What turns on the answer: the lazy-definition alert ("Add a blank line
// above it") and fix-lazy's inserted blank for a label Reading view
// already renders as a footnote - the same false advice the
// bug-label-after-pipeless-table family warns about. If instead Reading
// view behaves like the plugin, the pins below are the right model and
// nothing needs fixing; either way the exact title-line grammar Obsidian
// accepts has never been probed beyond bug-label-under-multiline-lrd's
// plain double-quoted title.
//
// NEEDS A LIVE CHECK: in Reading view, does the note
// "[foo]: /url\n\"a \\\" b\"\n[^1]: x" render the [^1] as a footnote, and
// does "> \"title\"" under a column-0 LRD leave a column-0 label under it
// lazy?
//
// Settings involved: `Fix definitions hidden by a missing blank line`
// and its alert twin.
