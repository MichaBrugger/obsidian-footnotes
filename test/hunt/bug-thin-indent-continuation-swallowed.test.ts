// A footnote definition's continuation paragraph after a BLANK line needs
// four spaces of indent (CommonMark's footnote rules, and micromark's
// GFM-footnote oracle agrees: "[^1]: x", blank, "   y" parses "y" as a
// NEW paragraph outside the definition, while "    y" stays inside). The
// block walker's blank-gap branch tests IndentedContent (/^\s+\S/), which
// accepts ONE space, so a line indented one to three spaces after the gap
// is swallowed into the definition block. The quoted-definition walk
// (quotedDefinitionEnd) requires /^ {4}/ for the very same decision, so
// the walker contradicts its own sibling here.
//
// What the user sees, with "Delete orphaned definitions" ON: a note like
// "[^9]: stray", blank, "   important prose", blank, "text" lints to
// "text" - the prose paragraph is deleted as if it were the stray
// footnote's body, which it never was. Silent destruction of live text.
// With move-to-bottom, the same paragraph is dragged to the bottom glued
// under the definition, when only the definition should have moved.
//
// Source of truth: the micromark + mdast-util-gfm-footnote oracle in
// node_modules (the repo's designated referee; no manual sheet records
// Reading view disagreeing with it here), CommonMark's indented-
// continuation rule, and the plugin's own quotedDefinitionEnd (/^ {4}/
// for the identical blank-gap question).
//
// Settings involved: `Delete orphaned definitions` ON for the text loss;
// `Move definitions to the bottom` (default ON) for the misplacement.
