// A table cannot interrupt a paragraph (GFM): a table header directly
// under plain paragraph text is no table at all, and the "delimiter" and
// "rows" render as literal pipes inside the paragraph (Kimi hunt cycle 3,
// probed in Reading view 2026-09-16). tableRowLinesOf knows, and its
// paragraphTextAbove refuses to call the run a table when plain text sits
// above it.
//
// But its idea of "plain paragraph text" refuses ANY line that starts
// with "<", meant to catch HTML block openers. That over-fires on lines
// that are plain text everywhere, including in the plugin's own scan:
// "<3" is not a tag (CommonMark 4.6 needs a letter after the "<"), and a
// "<span>" INSIDE an open paragraph is inline HTML, not a block (type 7
// cannot interrupt a paragraph - the scan's htmlBlockOpener agrees and
// opens nothing there). Under such a line the table check says "table",
// where micromark (run as the oracle) parses one paragraph with literal
// pipes, and Reading view's recorded plain-text probe says the same.
//
// The misread cascades: the "table" ends the block above it, so a label
// directly under the run is read as a DEFINITION (Jason's ruling A2)
// where Reading view shows lazy prose - move-to-bottom then drags the
// "definition" away, reindex numbers it, orphan rules judge it.
//
// What the user sees: they write "<3" (or an inline "<span>" mid-
// paragraph) over some pipe doodles and a "[^1]:" line; the lint treats
// the label as a real footnote definition and hauls it to the bottom,
// while Reading view never showed a footnote there at all.
//
// Source of truth: GFM via the micromark oracle (one paragraph, no
// table) + the cycle-3 Reading view probe (a table header directly under
// plain paragraph text is no table; "<3" is plain paragraph text).
//
// Settings involved: none for the scan; every lint rule inherits the
// misread.
