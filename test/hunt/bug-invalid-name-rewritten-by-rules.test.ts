// Scenario: a name with a space in it is not a footnote to Obsidian, it is
// ordinary prose, but the lint rules still treat it as one and rewrite or
// delete it.
//
// What the user would see: a line of their own writing such as
// "[^my note]: The full citation goes here." vanishes from the note when
// lint runs with "Delete orphaned definitions" switched on, and a sentence
// like "Alpha[^ 1]. Bravo." has its punctuation shuffled into
// "Alpha.[^ 1] Bravo." on the default settings. Nothing warns them; the
// text is simply gone or moved.
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13. Lens: grammar.
//
// Source of truth:
//  - micromark-extension-gfm-footnote 2.1.0 rejects a space or a tab inside
//    a label outright. Checked against the copy in node_modules: "see [^ 1]"
//    renders as an ordinary link, and "[^1 ]: prose" renders as a paragraph,
//    not as a definition.
//  - src/parsing/footnote-grammar.ts says the same thing in its own note:
//    Obsidian will not render a footnote whose name holds whitespace
//    (Jason, 2026-08-10).
//  - The plugin already has this policy for the sibling rule. In
//    remove-orphaned-references.ts: "Deleting [^my note] would destroy
//    ordinary prose, so those stay", pinned in
//    test/orphaned-references.test.ts.
//  - ADR-0002.
//
// Note on the reference pattern itself: the permissive regex that matches
// these shapes is deliberate, so the invalid-name alert can see them and
// warn. Seeing them is fine. Rewriting them is the bug.
