// BUG: a definition block is allowed to end while still owning a comment
// opener whose closer is further down the note, so every rule that moves
// whole definition blocks tears the commented-out region in half.
//
// What the user would see: a footnote definition whose continuation line
// opens a comment ("    %%" or "    <!--") to hide the notes underneath it.
// Running lint moves that definition, and the opener travels with it while
// the closer stays where it was. Text the user had hidden becomes visible,
// visible text becomes hidden, and in the worst of the six cases below the
// orphan rule deletes the hidden lines outright.
//
// Why it happens: findDefinitionBlocks walks a definition's continuation
// lines and absorbs the interior of a region that a continuation line
// opens, but it stops at the end of the indented run instead of at the
// region's closer. The block it hands back therefore contains an opener
// and no closer, and every mover trusts the block boundaries it is given.
// This is not a "%%" problem: the HTML-comment twins are protected text and
// misbehave in exactly the same way, which is why all six are pinned here.
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13. Lens: comments.
// Source of truth: the spec pin "inside a definition continuation, an
// indented opener hides the rest of the body" in spec-obsidian-comments;
// the A1 precedent (2026-09-08) recorded in findDefinitionBlocks' doc
// comment, where move-to-bottom dragged a "-->" away and left the comment
// unclosed; attack-surface "%% comments" row ("nothing inside a block
// comment is moved, renamed, or fixed"); ADR-0002 (lint never eats text the
// user did not opt into losing) for the deletion case.
