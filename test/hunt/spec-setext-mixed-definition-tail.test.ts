// SPEC QUESTION: where does a definition end when a setext underline follows
// a MIXED run - an indented continuation line and then a plain lazy line?
//
//     [^1]: body
//         cont
//     para
//     ===
//         code[^9]
//
// Two recorded Reading-view probes bear on it and they answer differently by
// mechanism. The cycle-12 probes ("a setext underline under a definition's
// LAZY line pulls that line out as a heading ... while under an INDENTED
// continuation the underline is the footnote's body text") read the line
// DIRECTLY above the underline: "para" is a plain lazy line, so the
// underline is a heading, the definition ends above it, and the chunk after
// the heading is indented code - "[^9]" is dead. The cycle-5 document-level
// probe ("a setext underline makes a heading of a ONE-line paragraph only")
// counts the paragraph's lines: the run above the underline is "cont" +
// "para" (two lines, the label's own text not counting per the cycle-12
// probes), so the underline is literal text, the footnote carries on, and
// the chunk after it is the footnote's live body - "[^9]" is live.
//
// The plugin implements BOTH answers in different readers, and they
// disagree on this exact shape. definitionStartLines (the label walk) ends
// the definition at the underline (its `open === "definition" &&
// setextUnderline` branch judges only the directly-above line, which is
// unindented -> open = "none"), and the block walker agrees (the block ends
// at the indented continuation, the lazy line refused because a setext
// underline follows it). scanDocument's own state machine instead runs
// oneLineParagraphAbove, which counts the indented "cont" as a paragraph
// line, gets 2, calls the underline literal, and keeps the definition open -
// so isProtected says the chunk is LIVE footnote text.
//
// What the user would see: the plugin hands the chunk's "[^9]" out as a
// taken number and reindexes it (its own protection facts call it live),
// while the lint's block walker treats the definition as ending at "para" -
// so the first lint moves the definition away from its tail, the chunk
// becomes code in the moved note, and the reference the plugin itself had
// been counting flips dead in one lint. Whichever way Reading view answers,
// one of the plugin's two readings is wrong; only a Reading-view probe of
// the mixed run can say which.
//
// Source of truth: the two recorded probes above (cycle 12 vs cycle 5,
// manual sheets 25/21) + the plugin's own two readers, quoted. Filed as a
// spec question per the hunt rules: where Reading view cannot be consulted,
// the disagreement is recorded, not judged.
//
// Settings involved: none for the scan; `Move definitions to the bottom`
// inherits whichever answer is wrong.
