// CommonMark 4.5: the info string of a BACKTICK fence may not itself
// contain a backtick, so "``` `x`" is not a fence at all - it is
// paragraph text. A code span opened on the line above therefore closes
// inside it: "para `code [^1]" over "``` `x`" is one paragraph holding
// one code span "code [^1]\n``` " followed by literal "x`" (verified
// with the micromark oracle). Reading view renders cross-line code spans
// as one span the same way (sheet 18, B30).
//
// The scanner's paragraphGoesOn walk, which decides whether a code span
// may close on a later line, stops at any line matching
// /^ {0,3}(`{3,}|~{3,})/ - the fence SHAPE, without isFenceOpener's
// backtick-in-info check. So the walk stops at "``` `x`", the span is
// read as never closing, and the "[^1]" inside it comes back LIVE: the
// orphan alert names it, the numbered command reserves its number,
// reindex renumbers it, and `Delete orphaned references` cuts it out of
// what Reading view shows as a code span.
//
// What the user sees: with `Delete orphaned references` ON, the lint
// deletes "[^1]" out of a code span - live code text destroyed - or, with
// the toggle off, the lint alert insists a reference inside a code span
// has no definition.
//
// Source of truth: CommonMark 4.5 (backtick fence info strings) +
// micromark oracle output below + sheet 18's B30 (Reading view renders
// the cross-line span as one).
//
// Settings involved: none for the scan; the orphan alert/deletion
// inherits it.
