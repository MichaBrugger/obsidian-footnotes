// BUG: a link whose web address contains its own pair of round brackets,
// like every Wikipedia disambiguation address, gets a footnote reference
// dropped into the middle of the address.
//
// What the user would see: pressing the numbered hotkey on the last word
// of the link text writes
//   see [bravo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba_(disambiguation)[^1]#hist) now
// instead of putting "[^1]" after the whole link. The link is broken from
// that moment on: the address stops at the reference. Linting an existing
// note does the same damage, and once the reference sits after a ")" the
// lint rule reads it as already correctly placed, so a second lint pass
// leaves it there for good. Nothing short of hand editing puts it back.
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13. Lens: the landing convention.
//
// Source of truth:
//  - CommonMark 0.31.2, section 6.3: a link destination may contain
//    balanced parentheses, so "(...Ba_(disambiguation)#hist)" is ONE tail.
//  - manual former sheet 01, line ~30: "The link case lands after the whole
//    (url), never between ] and (".
//  - manual former sheet 20, line ~55: the same swap for the plain-link case in
//    the punctuation lint rule.
//  - referenceLandingAfter's own doc comment: "A markdown link's '(url)'
//    tail right after a ']' is stepped over whole, so the reference never
//    splits '[text](url)'."
//
// Cause: the walk finds the end of the tail with
// text.indexOf(")", at + 2), which is the FIRST ")" rather than the one
// that closes the tail.
//
// Settings: the defaults (end-of-word insertion on). Wikipedia addresses
// are everywhere in Jason's notes, so this is a common shape, not an
// exotic one.
