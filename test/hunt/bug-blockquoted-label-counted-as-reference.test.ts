// BUG (review A3, Jason confirmed live 2026-09-08): footnoteReferenceMatches
// excluded a definition's own label only at COLUMN 0, so a blockquoted
// label ("> [^9]: quoted orphan") counted as a reference. Reindex's
// appearance order then handed that orphan number 1, ahead of the footnote
// the text actually uses - while the orphan alert still (correctly) named
// it as an orphan. remove-orphaned-definitions already excluded such labels
// locally; the exclusion now lives in referenceOccurrences, the one home of
// "every reference on this line", so every rule agrees.
