// Obsidian turns a setext underline into a heading only when ONE line
// sits above it: "para", "more", "===" renders as a paragraph with a
// literal "===" (Kimi hunt cycle 3, probed in Reading view 2026-09-16).
// The plugin's own definitionStartLines knows - paragraphLinesAbove
// counts the run and only lets a one-line paragraph be underlined.
//
// scanDocument's blockEnder never got the one-line rule. It sees "==="
// under ANY open paragraph as a block ender, so the block ends there and
// an indented chunk on the next line opens as indented CODE. Reading
// view keeps the paragraph open (the "===" is literal text), and an
// indented line after a paragraph line is a lazy continuation - indented
// code cannot interrupt a paragraph, the very rule the scan relies on
// everywhere else. So a reference in the chunk is LIVE to Obsidian and
// DEAD to the plugin: reindex skips it, the numbered command hands its
// number out again, the press guard refuses there, and the orphan alert
// never names it.
//
// What the user sees: they write a two-line paragraph, a line of equals
// signs (a literal divider, say), and an indented code block with a
// "[^1]" in it - wait, no: Reading view shows the "[^1]" as a LIVE
// footnote reference with no definition, but the lint never warns about
// it, and the next numbered footnote the plugin inserts reuses [^1],
// colliding with it.
//
// Source of truth: the cycle-3 Reading view probe (setext only under one
// line) + the plugin's own definitionStartLines/paragraphLinesAbove,
// which reads the same "===" as literal - the two readers in
// markdown-scan.ts disagree about the same line.
//
// Settings involved: none (the scan itself).
