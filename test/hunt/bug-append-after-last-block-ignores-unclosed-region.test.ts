// BUG: when the note already has a definition, the append goes straight
// after the last definition block and never checks whether the note ends
// inside a comment or a fence that was never closed.
//
// What the user would see: a note whose last definition has a continuation
// line that opens a comment or a code fence and never closes it. Creating
// another footnote writes the new definition at the end of that hidden run,
// so it is hidden too. The footnote renders as plain text, and because lint
// can no longer see the definition, the next run reports the brand new
// reference as an orphan.
//
// Why it happens: buildDefinitionAppend has a guard for exactly this, the
// bug #10 walk that climbs above an unclosed region. But the guard sits
// below the "blocks.length > 0" early return, and that early return never
// looks at endsProtected. The three openers below all produce the same
// definition block, lines 2 to 4, with endsProtected true, so the append
// lands on line 4 inside the hidden run every time. It is the same root
// cause as the sibling pin about a definition block owning an opener
// without its closer.
//
// Hunt: 2026-09-13. Lens: comments.
// Source of truth: definition-append.ts's own bug #10 comment ("A
// definition added at the very end would be born inside it as dead text,
// and the next lint would then delete its live reference as an orphan");
// attack-surface "%% comments" row ("the definition append never lands
// inside an unclosed block"); manual sheet 18 line ~118 ("nothing is
// inserted or moved inside either %% block").
