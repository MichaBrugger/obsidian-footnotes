// Review B1 (2026-09-09): insideReferenceShape walked outward from every
// dollar and backtick candidate, to the start of the line whenever no
// bracket or NUL lay behind it, so a long line of prices masked in
// quadratic time (measured: 1000 chars 14 ms, 8000 chars 344 ms). The walk
// is now answered from two lazily built state tables. The bound here is
// generous on purpose (a timing pin must not flake on a slow machine); the
// old code missed it by a factor of ten and more. The timing half now lives
// in test/perf/masking-linear.perf.test.ts (Stryker's instrumented dry run
// is several times slower and failed it); this file keeps the guard's
// answers.
