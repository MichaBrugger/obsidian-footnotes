// A blank line inside a blockquote (">" with nothing after it) ends the
// quote's open block: a lazy continuation cannot cross a blank line, and
// the blank-quote-line branch in scanDocument says so itself ("a blank
// '>' line is a block boundary inside the quote"). So a column-0 line
// after it starts a NEW block at the document level, and an indented
// chunk there is CommonMark indented CODE - reference-shaped text inside
// it is dead. Verified against micromark: "> quote\n>\n    code[^1]"
// parses as blockquote(paragraph) + code.
//
// The scanner's quote.boundary records the boundary INSIDE the quote, but
// the document-level blockBoundary is never set by the blank quote line,
// so the chunk reads as a lazy paragraph continuation and its [^1] is
// LIVE. (A truly blank line does set blockBoundary, which is why
// "> quote\n\n    code" is already handled.)
//
// What the user sees: the dead [^1] reserves a number (their next real
// footnote skips one), the missing-definition alert nags about code text,
// and with `Delete orphaned references` ON the lint cuts the [^1] OUT of
// the code block - and "lint never touches code" (Jason's ruling
// 2026-08-10).
//
// Source of truth: CommonMark's lazy-continuation rule (a paragraph
// cannot be lazily continued across a blank line) via micromark as run
// for this hunt + the scanner's own comment for the blank-quote branch.
//
// Settings involved: `Delete orphaned references` for the destructive
// half; the default numbering and alerts for the rest.
