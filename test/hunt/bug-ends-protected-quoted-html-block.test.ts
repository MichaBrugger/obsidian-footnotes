// BUG: `endsProtectedNow` in markdown-scan.ts returns `htmlBlock !== null`
// with no container check - the ONE region state without one. Every other
// region gates on its container: a fence needs `depth === 0 && listColumn
// === null`, a %% block `commentBlock.depth === 0`, an inline comment or
// math region `regionDepth === 0`, and the module's own comment says why:
// "An unclosed region inside a blockquote can't reach a line appended at
// the end of the note: that appended line ends the quote, exactly as it
// does for a fence inside a blockquote ... a fence inside a LIST ITEM
// can't reach it either". An HTML block is container-bounded everywhere
// else in the same scanner - the htmlBlock branch's own `inContainer` test
// ends the block at the first line shallower than its container (the same
// shape the fence branch implements), and CommonMark says the same (a
// leaf block inside a container ends with the container). So a note whose
// LAST line sits inside a quoted or list-item HTML block reports
// `endsProtected` true, and:
//
//   - move-to-bottom refuses to gather definitions at all (the rule's own
//     contract: "A note that ends inside an unclosed code fence or comment
//     comes back untouched"), even though Reading view renders an appended
//     "[^1]: def" as a live footnote there - the container, quote or item,
//     ends at the appended column-0 line and the HTML block dies with it
//     (micromark oracle: "> <div>\n> more html\n[^1]: def\n\nuse [^1]"
//     parses the definition and renders the footnote; the blockquote
//     closes before it).
//   - the definition append walks the new definition ABOVE the quoted
//     block instead of to the bottom, via the same endsProtectedAt flags.
//
// What the user sees: on a note that ends with an HTML fragment inside a
// quote or a list item (a pasted `<div>` card, say), every lint leaves the
// definitions where they are, scattered mid-note, and reports
// "Footnotes linted." - the never-silent posture never applies because no
// rule can see the problem. The document-level control (an unclosed
// `<div>` at the column-0 end of the note) is correctly refused.
//
// Source of truth: CommonMark 4.6/4.8 container semantics + micromark
// ("--- quoted html block then appended definition:" renders the footnote)
// + the plugin's own A3 ruling recorded in endsProtectedNow's comment (an
// appended line ends the quote/item, probed for fences) + the plugin's own
// inContainer logic, which already says the block dies with its container.
// Residual doubt flagged honestly: Obsidian is recorded to let a `%%`
// comment or `$$` math block opened in a CONTAINER run on past the append
// (the endsProtectedNow comment), so a live Reading-view probe of the
// exact HTML shape would settle it; the internal inconsistency (four
// region states checked, one not) stands either way.
//
// Settings involved: `Gather definitions` (move-to-bottom), and every
// creation press that appends a definition (buildDefinitionAppend).
