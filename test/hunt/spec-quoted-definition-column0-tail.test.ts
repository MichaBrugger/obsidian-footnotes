// REFUTED 2026-09-16 (GLM hunt cycle 9, probed in Reading view): a plain column-0 line directly under a quoted definition is the quoted footnote's lazy body ("quoted def plain column-0 line"), further plain lines carry it on, a label under them starts a new definition, a heading ends the run, and an indented chunk after the tail is code. definitionStartLines was right; quotedDefinitionEnd now owns the tail, the scan protects the chunk, and the press guard reaches the tail.

// SPEC QUESTION: does a column-0 plain line after a quoted definition line
// lazily continue the quote's definition, or start a fresh paragraph
// outside the quote?
//
//     > [^1]: quoted def
//     plain column-0 line
//     [^2]: second
//
// The plugin answers this question in TWO OPPOSITE WAYS, and one of them
// must be wrong about Obsidian:
//
// - definitionStartLines carries its "definition" state across the
//   column-0 line (the lazyContinuation branch: "A plain line directly
//   under a definition is the definition's own lazy continuation"), so
//   "[^2]: second" reads as a DEFINITION start.
// - quotedDefinitionEnd stops the quoted definition at its own label line
//   ("each following non-blank quoted line at the same depth ... a change
//   of quote depth end it"), so the column-0 line is NOT part of the
//   quoted definition. Under sheet 14's prose-label rule, a label directly
//   under a plain paragraph line is then LAZY text.
//
// If Obsidian reads the column-0 line as a new paragraph outside the quote
// (what quotedDefinitionEnd's recorded Reading-view extent implies), the
// consequences today are: "[^2]: second" is gathered as a definition and,
// with `Delete orphaned definitions` ON, a line Obsidian renders as prose
// is CUT; the lazy-definition alert never names it. If instead the
// column-0 line lazily continues the quote's definition inside the quote
// (CommonMark's lazy continuation through a container), then
// quotedDefinitionEnd is the reader that is wrong, and orphan deletion of
// a quoted label would strand its column-0 lazy body.
//
// NEEDS A LIVE CHECK: in Reading view, does "> [^1]: quoted def" then
// "plain column-0 line" then "[^2]: second" render "[^2]: second" as a
// footnote entry at the bottom (definition), or as plain text with no
// entry (lazy), or folded into footnote 1's body (lazy continuation of the
// quote's definition)?
//
// Source of truth: manual sheet 14 (the prose-label rule) + the
// quotedDefinitionEnd contract recorded as verified in Reading view
// 2026-09-16; Obsidian unprobed for this exact adjacency.
//
// Settings involved: `Delete orphaned definitions` (the prose line is cut),
// `Fix definitions hidden by a missing blank line` (never offered).
