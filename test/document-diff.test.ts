// Jason's manual pass, former sheet 20 (2026-09-11): linting unfolded every folded
// heading and list in the note, and the caret jumped to one of the linted
// spots. Both came from how the lint wrote its result back: one edit
// spanning from the first changed character to the last, which replaced
// every untouched fold and every caret position in between.
//
// lineDiffChanges turns a before/after pair into the smallest set of
// line-range edits, so the editor keeps its folds and maps the caret
// through untouched text unchanged.
