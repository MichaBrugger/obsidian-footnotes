// The setup and teardown every rewriting rule used to repeat for itself,
// gathered here (duplicated-logic audit, 2026-09-05). The steps: convert the
// note's line endings to plain LF, split it into lines, scan it, run the
// rule, then put the note's own line endings back.
//
// The one subtlety is what happens when the rule changed nothing. Then the
// ORIGINAL text is handed back byte for byte, without the ending-restoring
// step. A note with mixed line endings would otherwise come out with them
// all made the same, and the lint would report a change the user never
// asked for. (Decided 2026-08-10; pinned by spec-mixed-eol-noop-rewrite.)

// each rule builds its own view of the text it receives. On a clean note
// most rules hand their text back unchanged, so the next rule receives the
// identical string and used to scan it all over again. Now a view whose
// text matches the memo starts with the previous view's finished pieces.
//
// The memo is keyed on the exact text, so a rule that changed anything
// gets a fresh scan as before. The rules themselves are untouched: still
// markdown in, markdown out. The memo is dropped when the outermost call
// returns, so no note is kept in memory after a lint, and a rule run on its
// own (as the tests do) behaves exactly as it did before.
