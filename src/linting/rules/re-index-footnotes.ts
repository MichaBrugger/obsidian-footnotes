//
// - Numbered footnotes are renumbered 1, 2, 3 and so on, in the order their
//   references first appear, and their definitions are put in the same
//   order.
// - Named footnotes keep their names, unless renumberNamedFootnotes is on,
//   but they still take their place in that ordering of definitions.
// - Orphaned definitions are kept, and numbered after everything that is
//   referenced, unless keepOrphanedDefinitions is off.
// - Code and frontmatter are invisible to all of this.
