// forms). It is escaped here so it can go inside a regular expression's
// square brackets.

// "\[^1]" is literal prose, and the brackets of an "^[...]" inline footnote
// belong to that footnote. This file used to find them with a regular
// expression of its own, which swapped those shapes as well and so turned
// text the user had typed on purpose into a live reference (2026-08-11
// review, bug #1).
//
// An inline footnote moves too, as ONE unit, its whole "^[...]" span with
// the body untouched (N1 of the 2026-09 feature round; Jason, 2026-09-19:
// the exclusion was never intended, and inline and normal footnotes should
// place the same way). The span comes from the grammar's inline scanner,
// never from treating the footnote's brackets as a reference, which is
// exactly what bug #1 was. A body that runs onto the next line never
// closes on this line, so it is not a unit and stays where it is.

// built from the original line. Otherwise a footnote name could come out
