// what it does by default, or, with the "Orphaned references" setting on
// Delete, takes them out of the text.
//
// Three kinds of reference are left alone either way:
//
//  - Names are compared without regard to case, so a definition written
//    with different capitals still counts as that reference's definition.
//  - A name Obsidian will not accept, one with a space or a backtick in it,
//    is not a footnote there either. Deleting "[^my note]" would destroy
//    ordinary prose, so those stay. The creation path already warns about
//    such names.
//  - The note's own bare-prefix placeholder, "[^2.]" in a note whose prefix
//    is "2.", is a footnote the user is in the middle of naming. The
//    unnamed-reference alert speaks for it. Deleting it from under the
//    user's caret would be losing their work.
