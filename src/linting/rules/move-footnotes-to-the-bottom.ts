// The obsidian-linter plugin's "move footnotes to the bottom" rule,
// rewritten here as a pure function and joined up with this plugin's
// section-heading setting. What it should and should not do is pinned by
// test/move-footnotes-to-bottom.test.ts.
//
// The layout it produces deliberately matches the one buildDefinitionAppend
// produces when the plugin inserts a definition. That means a note the
// plugin built is already in its final shape: running this rule over it
// changes nothing.

/**
 * Guard against a note's first line turning into frontmatter.
 *
 * A note whose FIRST line is "---" with no matching "---" later on reads as
 * a horizontal rule. But add a "---" or "..." at the left margin further
 * down, and Obsidian re-reads the whole top of the note as a YAML
 * frontmatter block. Everything caught in it, prose and references alike,
 * quietly stops being part of the note's body. (Verified against
 * metadataCache's section types, 2026-08-10.)
 *
 * This was found by the differential test that compares the plugin against
 * the remark parser: gathering definitions under a "---\n## Footnotes"
 * heading closed that phantom block, and reindex then handed the name of a
 * swallowed reference to an orphaned definition.
 *
 * So when rebuilding the note would flip that reading, one blank line goes
 * in front. It renders exactly the same, and frontmatter can only open on
 * the very first line, so line 0 stays ordinary content for good.

/**
 * Gather every footnote definition block into the note's footnote section,
 * leaving the blocks in the order they were already in. Putting them in a
 * different order is reindexFootnotes' job, not this one.
 *
 * Where they gather depends on the section heading. `sectionHeading` is the
 * setting's value exactly as the user typed it. When it is set and the note
 * contains an exact copy of it outside protected text, the FIRST such copy
 * fixes the spot: the definitions gather directly under it, WHEREVER in the
 * note it happens to be. The lint has to respect where the user put their
 * footnote section instead of hauling it down to the bottom (issue #55
 * follow-up, reported 2026-08-05).
 *
 * With no such heading to aim at, the definitions move to the end of the
 * note, and the heading, if one is configured, is put in above them. Blank
 * lines always separate them from the text around them.
 *
 * A note that ends inside an unclosed code fence or comment comes back
 * untouched: anything added at the end would land inside that region and
 * stop being a definition at all.
