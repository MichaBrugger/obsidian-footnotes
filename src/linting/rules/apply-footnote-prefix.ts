// The "Apply footnote prefix" rule, added to make life easier
// (2026-07-18).
//
// A prefix is a per-note namespace, like "2.", put in front of footnote
// names so that chapters merged into one document do not collide. Footnotes
// written before the note was given its footnote-prefix property do not
// carry it. This rule renames them so they do.
//
// Plain numbered footnotes are converted in the order they first appear:
// references first, then any orphaned definitions. They are numbered
// starting AFTER the highest prefixed footnote already in the note, so no
// new name lands on an existing one.
//
// Named footnotes keep their name, behind the prefix: "[^note]" becomes
// "[^2.note]" (A6 bug, 2026-07-20). The exception is when that prefixed
// name is already some other footnote in the note, because the rename would
// then quietly merge two footnotes into one; such a name is left alone.
//
// Footnotes already carrying the prefix are not touched. Definitions are
// not reordered either; putting them in order is reindex's job, so
// definition blocks stay where they are.
//
// This runs BEFORE reindex in the lint, so footnotes converted here are
// renumbered into reading order by the same lint.
//
// Running the lint twice cannot change anything a second time: everything
// this rule touches comes out carrying the prefix, and carrying the prefix
// is exactly what makes the rule skip a footnote.

/**
 * Rename every footnote that does not yet carry `prefix` so that it does. An
 * invalid prefix changes nothing here; the lint guard has already cancelled
 * such a run before it reaches this point.
