// The smallest set of line-range edits that turns one version of a note
// into another.
//
// Why it exists (Jason's report, former sheet 20, 2026-09-11): the lint used to
// write its result back as ONE edit, from the first changed character to
// the last. Everything between those two points was replaced wholesale,
// even the lines that had not changed at all. That threw away every folded
// heading and list in the span, and the caret, if it sat anywhere inside,
// was pushed to the span's start. Editing only the lines that really
// changed leaves folds alone and lets the editor carry the caret through
// untouched text unchanged.
//
// How it works: lines that match at the start and at the end are skipped
// first. What is left in the middle goes through a longest-common-
// subsequence comparison on whole lines, and each run of lines that does
// not match becomes one edit. A very large middle (millions of line pairs
// to compare) falls back to one edit for the whole middle, so a giant note
// never stalls the app.
