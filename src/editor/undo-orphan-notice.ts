// Feedback for a PARTIAL undo (Jason's report 2026-08-27; the notice is
// always on, his call).
//
// Creating a footnote from inside a table cell takes TWO undo steps. The
// reference has to be written through the cell's own editor, because
// writing the row through the main editor while a cell holds focus is the
// issue #28 corruption family, while the definition rides a main-editor
// transaction. CodeMirror's history only groups changes that arrive
// together in one dispatch, so those two can never share an undo step.
//
// The first undo used to strand an orphaned reference in the table without
// a word about it; this listener says so. It speaks up for every
// partial-undo orphan, not just tables: undoing the definition press of the
// named flow leaves the typed reference behind the same way, and the
// guidance is identical.

/**
 * The names this undo orphaned: defined before it, not defined after it,
 * and still referenced afterwards. Reported in the casing the definition
 * itself used.
 *
 * Both sides are judged on the masked twin, so a footnote-shaped decoy
 * inside a code span neither sets the notice off nor holds it back (the A20
 * decoy lesson), and names are compared case-insensitively as everywhere
 * else. Pure function; exported so unit tests can call it.
