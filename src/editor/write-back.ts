/**
 * Put every other pane back where it was. Obsidian copies a rewrite into
 * the other panes on the same note a moment later, as one whole
 * replacement, which drops each pane's caret to the top of the note and
 * can shift its scroll (Jason's report, sheet 19, 2026-09-24: the pane he
 * was not typing in jumped, and a split view is on purpose). The copy
 * lands within about 200 ms (probed live, 2026-09-24), so this waits for
 * each pane's text to become the new text, then puts its selection back,
 * carried through the edits the way folds are, and its scroll position
 * after it. A pane whose copy never lands is left alone after a second.
 *
 * The scroll position is put back by LINE, not by pixel. CodeMirror only
 * measures the lines it has drawn and estimates the rest, and the copy
 * throws those estimates away, so the old pixel offset lands on a
 * different line once lines wrap or vary in height (Jason's second
 * report, 2026-09-24: the caret line came back near the bottom of the
 * window; probed live: a 96 px drift in a narrow pane of wrapped lines).
 * So the line that was at the top edge of the window is asked to sit at
 * the top edge again, through CodeMirror's own scroll request, which it
 * re-applies after every measurement until it holds; a beat later the
 * pixels the edge sat into that line are added back, now that the line
 * has been drawn and measured. Setting the selection through the view
 * rather than the editor keeps Obsidian from also asking for the caret
 * to be scrolled into view, which would win over the restore and park
 * the caret line at the bottom edge (probed live, 2026-09-24).
