// Every toast the plugin shows goes through showNotice.

// The problem it solves: Obsidian's notice uses `overflow-wrap: anywhere`,
// which lets a full line break between ANY two characters. So a quoted
// footnote name could come out as `Add a"` at the end of one line and
// `[^bob]" reference` at the start of the next (Jason's report 2026-09-04,
// right after every toast gained the quotes for consistency).
//
// A quoted reference should read as one thing, so it is wrapped in a
// no-wrap span: the quotes, the brackets and the name always land on the
// same line. A message with none of them stays a plain string.

// ---- Shared toast text ------------------------------------------------
// One string per rule, assembled from shared pieces (Jason, 2026-09-05).
// A refusal that means the same thing says the same thing wherever it
// fires, which leaves fewer separate strings to keep in step and, later,
// to translate.
