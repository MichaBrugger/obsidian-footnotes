// Inline footnotes, the self-contained "^[...]" form. This file holds three

// that finds an inline footnote's span while respecting backslash escapes,
// and the two caret guards every command shares. Split out of the
// all-in-one commands file 2026-08-11.

/**
 * The last stretch of both paste commands, shared by the single-caret and
 * the multi-caret paste. It used to be copied between the two, and this is
 * the one duplicate where the copies drifting apart would be dangerous.
 *
 * It does three things in order. Read the clipboard, which is the only
 * await in either command. Then check the view mode again, because the user
 * (or a script) can switch to Reading view while the clipboard permission
 * prompt is up, and the editor API would then edit the hidden buffer behind
 * it (2026-08-11 review). Then refuse an empty body.
 *
 * Returns the finished "^[…]" text, or null when the press is already
 * settled: the failure or the emptiness has been toasted, or the view can
 * no longer be edited. Callers must run every guard BEFORE calling this, so
 * that a press which will be refused never touches the clipboard at all.
