// Conversion: turning selected text into a footnote (issue #35).
//
// Normally a footnote command inserts at the caret. When you have text
// selected, it replaces that text instead. Each key does it its own way:
//
//   numbered - the selected text moves into a new definition's body
//   inline   - the selected text is wrapped as "^[…]" where it sits
//   named    - a small modal asks for the name, then the numbered
//              behavior runs under the name you typed
//   paste    - refuses and points you at the other three keys
//
// The named key needs the modal because the usual named flow takes two
// presses, and two presses cannot carry a body without keeping state
// between them (Jason's ask 2026-08-13). The paste key refuses because
// its body is the clipboard, so a press with a selection is genuinely
// ambiguous: two candidate bodies, no way to pick.
//
// There is no setting for any of this; it is always on (Jason's call,
// 2026-08-12). Before it existed, a press with a selection inserted at
// the old caret position, which served nobody.
//
// Multi-line selections convert too (Jason's ask 2026-08-19, because
// academic footnotes hold whole paragraphs). The numbered and named keys
// turn the selected block into a multi-paragraph definition, its
// continuation lines indented four spaces. That is the shape the scanner
// and the jump commands already understand. The inline key refuses a
// selection that spans lines and points at those two keys instead
// (Jason's ruling 2026-08-20: flattening it the way paste does almost
// never looked right except on clean paragraphs, and paste already
// covers that use case).
//
// Protected text (fences, math, comments, inline code spans) can travel
// into the footnote, but only when the selection contains the whole
// construct. A selection that CUTS one refuses: an edge sitting inside a
// construct, or one delimiter grabbed without its partner. Cutting like
// that would change how Obsidian reads innocent text further down the
// note.

// touches a live reference or a live inline footnote refuses: swallowing
// one whole would nest it in the new footnote's body, and overlapping one
// only partly would cut it in half. Reference-shaped text inside a code
// span is not a live footnote, so it travels along like ordinary text.
// (The refusal message is NestedFootnoteNotice, shared with the caret
// guards, so the one rule always speaks with one sentence.)
