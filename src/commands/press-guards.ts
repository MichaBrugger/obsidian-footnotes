/**
 * The caret guards that every footnote command runs before it acts. THE
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING; here it is, with what each step is for and what
 * goes wrong if it moves:
 *
 *  1. An EMPTY inline footnote asks for its text. This must come first,
 *     otherwise the "done typing" hop below fires on it instead.
 *  2. A filled inline footnote hops the caret past its closing bracket.
 *     This must beat the reference guards below, because an inline
 *     footnote's body can itself contain reference-shaped text.
 *  3. An abandoned "[^]" asks for a name, rather than having a new
 *     footnote nested inside its brackets.
 *  4. An untouched "[^7-]" prefix placeholder asks for a suffix.
 *
 * True means the press was used up, by a toast or by a hop, and the
 * command stops there.
 *
 * The inline and paste commands also navigate out of a real reference
 * (navigateReferenceIfInside), which they do at their own call sites. The
 * numbered and named commands run their own jump cascade instead.
 *
 * `cursorPosition` is the RESOLVED caret. The numbered and named commands
 * call this from inside runOutsideTableCell's callback, whose sub-editor
 * fallback works out the real position. The guards used to run before that,
 * on a stale getCursor() (2026-08-11 review bug #9).
